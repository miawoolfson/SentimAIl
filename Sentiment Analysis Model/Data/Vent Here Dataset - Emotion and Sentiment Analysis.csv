I am a university student and I thought I was pretty decent girl.
When I got to the second semester of my first year, I got a boyfriend he is a very lovely, really affectionate man. We dated for like 2 months which we had sex by that time... Then one time I went to his dorm nd I met his friend, who is super hot. So we got to talking nd I had no choice but to be in love with him. I told him that I liked him, he said the same thing. We dated for a while, we had sex of course. Then I saw his other friend, nd the same goddamn thing happens again. I am now a 3rd year student, nd I have been with a lottttta guys already. I hate this behavior of me but I just can't help it. Is it that the guy's circle is rly hot. Or I am I just being a slut. This just hurts me everyday, nd I just wanted to get this off my chest.

I have a confession to make. 
I got a call the day before yesterday with some curses at me and stupid threats from a number I didn't recognize. A little later, this ""ex"" I hadn't thought about in a very long time texts me. She calls me a bitch and that I'd pay for what I'd done. I call her and ask her what she's talking about but she wouldn't even give me a chance to deny her accusations; spits some curse words at me and hangs up. I text her saying I hadn't done anything and I've left her alone for all this time. She goes off at me and swears she'll make me pay for playing with her life. I promise her that if she doesn't leave me alone I'm gonna show her what playing with her life looks like. Her ""man,"" who was a friend of mine back in the day, then texts me with pretty much the same angry thoughts. I realized then that he was he one on the phone earlier. I block both their contacts and continue with my day. Then messenger says I've got a new message, from the sister. She asks why I'd been sending pictures of the ex to people, I tell her I hadn't and she's rational about it and let's it go. A little later I get a text from the ex. She threatens me some more and claims that since I've come after her family she has to make me pay. I ignore that text too. I've left them alone so far but they're pushing their luck. I'm usually a very nice guy but I've got something worse than the devil inside. I don't think even the devil can be as mean as me. I've got pictures of her. Interesting pictures. They'll be making an appearance on social media and her accusations of me sending pictures of her will finally come true. The best part about all of this is that they don't know what I've got in my arsenal. Stay happy people.

We had amazing communication from the start and our talks moved from fb messenger to phone conversation. We don't spend a day without taking. Morning noon and night. Then our talks somewhat revolved into hot topics. We had deep fantasies about each other. The one problem though is that he said that all we were going to be is phone friends. He never wanted to meet. There is nothing he hasn't told me about him and me too. Then one time, we had a long discussion and we decided to meet, but as friends with benefits. And that day, I skipped off work, got a room and waited for him. And guess what, he forgot about it. When he found out, he was very shocked. Then we decided to meet on a Sunday and that time we did. It was such a beautiful time for me. Maybe for him, it was just physical but it was such an intimate time for me. After that day tho, he literally didn't even want to continue our friends with benefits agreement, not even those late night phone talks. Now we are meeting as simple friends, nothing more. I jump at any chance to meet him but he doesn't. The guy who didn't want to meet in person is hanging out with me almost three days of the week but now, he is making sure to show me that he thinks nothing of me except as his very good friend.",neutral,POSITIVE,0.9530718922615051

2017-07-04 13:52:15,"Have you ever felt happy when your parents scold you?.. well I have.. 

My mom and dad have been fighting constantly with each other since the day I remember. They hate each other so much for the things that they've done to eachother. And all I could ever do was to just sit there crying all night unable to do anything. I'm 18 now and I don't remember a time when all of us ( my mom's and dad's family) sat together had a funny conversation had fun or even talk. 
I've been trying to avoid them for the past couple of years, their quarrels and stuff.. All I do is sit in my bed hear them shout at eachother for no reason at all..

I remember them happily  talking to each other mostly when my dad was abroad. About 3 yrs before, my dad came back home because I wasn't scoring enough marks in my tests... But fortunately I passed in everything with his help.

Recently I had my 12th grade exam and while the exam was going on, the evening before Maths exam, they start fighting about some random thing and my dad hit mom.. and things escalated​.. and I interfered (i usually don't) which made it worse. And it some how ended, i don't remember exactly. it was a rough night for me. I couldn't sleep all night. I kept thinking of how all of this is my fault, my dad coming back home, me scoring low marks, me interfering, everything. And I stayed awake all night, just like most of the days. Next day I was unable to attend my exam properly because I was sleepy and tired from all the shit. Something similar happened on the evening before Physics exam too, and all went to shit.
Fast forward 1 and 1/2 months I get my results I failed in both Maths and Physics by 2 marks. 
Soon it all came down. My mom and dad were sad and blamed me for not studying ( they don't remember what happened on those days) .

And yesterday they fought again (not because of me) and It​ was a lot for me to take in and I shouted out How it was all their mistake that I failed that if they had shut up for two days! It would have made a difference. And since yesterday I haven't said a word to them.
Today evening my mom and dad were having a conversation ( I overheard accidentally) , 
They were talking about how big of a pain I was to them. And that I was lying of them being the reason that I failed. And that I never really cared about them fighting with eachother, that I was just a show off.

Eventhough it was supposed to make me feel sad and suicidal, it kinda made me happy for them. They were standing side by side even if it was to talk like this. 

I never had a friend who I trusted, maybe it's because I just don't trust anyone. I don't talk to people much, I don't share my feelings with anyone, maybe I'm afraid.

And this is just 1/2 of my life.. the reason why they hate eachother so much will itself take me an hour to type. 

And thank you Unihorse. For creating this channel I wouldn't​have shared this with anyone.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9989628791809082
2017-07-05 07:48:40,"I hardly went to any class this semester and i was punished for that. For those who have gone through calculus,many will be quick to tell you how they narrowly escaped the fucking unit, with a number of them vowing to never wanting to experience something like that ever again. Myself, i thought the lecture halls were too packed and too noisy to read in. I pushed my luck and decided to watch youtube tutorials at the expense of going to class. All was well since i  was in my own comforts pretending to learn as much as my counterparts, while i was secretly streaming kaniel outis(prison break) and king in the north(game of thrones) on my laptop. Come exams day, all the odds were stacked against me. The examination halls were scarcely packed with each student miles away from each other. Even with my perfect zooming capacity in my cheap geeky glasses, i could hardly peek on my neighbours big handwriting. The eerie creepy feeling of the halls were very sickening as wafts of print on paper hang loosely in the atmosphere like a roaming ghost,trying to scare away all the gradient dx/dy that i had hurriedly uploaded into my head the previous night.
Trouble really blew up immediately after writing my name and  registration details. I skimmed through the paper confident that my youtube experience was the exhaustion of everything calculus had to offer. Soon the only sounds were pen on paper amid a few dry coughs and muffled whispers that instantly went mum on the high pitched exam supervisor's voice. I was already in mental turmoil as i approached number one question, fazed by the diverse collection of jargons in the paper. As soon as i started writing,i was already crossing words and numbers as i realized i had hit a dead end. All around me papers were perusing pages as i sat there staring blanky at my cursed pen and answer booklet. A chic next to me was already onto the third, as i crafted meaningless formulae, creation of my own to match her few answers that i had glimpsed as she turned her papers. Gradually i tried to scribble along until hell broke loose when she suddenly rose up to hand in her booklets. Like a wave,desks got dragged as more people thronged to hand in,leaving me and a few others(must be fellow youtube students) in a sea of gloom and  doom of a looming retake. I think i will attend all classes henceforth.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9993970394134521

Being brought up in a very rich , very Christian and very happy family life was NEVER hard. Not once have i struggled or had a battle to fight.I had everything anyone could ask for and no worries engulfed me. I love to tell myself i have alot of friend's because of my mother kindness that was passed along me.. buh soon enough i always come to realise that it is infact my father's money that they see through my eyes. Grade after Grade i had my so called friend's use me again and again. I never stayed  much i used to get away the first chance i got thinking i would run into better ones but no they were the same if not worse. The first time i made friends which was in Day care i had been trashed and over loved in my family's name. In a littel town such as where im from a family like mine was a huge deal. Some babies hated it hence i was bullied at a daycare level. Some loved it and i was shown fake smiles of 6 year olds. Moving up here in Addis i enrolled in a new school and Book wormed my life. The first 2 grades passed in a flash. I never spoke to a soul in school yet i was aware of everyone and everything. I used to go up the stage four times per event and shower with awards for best achiever. I didnt like it. So in 3rd grade i opened up and i regret it till this day. I have met great people during the journey and i hate the fact that they mean so much. Without the influence of anything people started getting attached to me. I became a peoples magnet. Under the harsh speaking cuss dressed mouth of mine people started seeing my mothers kind smile imprinted on me. The warm feeling that sparks within me every time someone speaks kind of me and the dark that cloud my eyes everytime i make someone unhappy scares me. A foreign feeling which i came to fear. Fears turned into weakness. From weakness rised cruelty. Which is a point as low as one can go. Like a crime scene waiting to happen i dont know what i will do if i fall for someone or even worse if they leave me there.

This confession is about my university life. For a long time the only thing i wanted was to make my parents feel proud of the woman i will become but that's all gone now. To my parents they still can experience that but deep down to me it will never be as legit  as i would have wanted it to be.

I joined college a pure person, didn't know anything apart from  books. Everything from kissing, relationships, sex, drugs and money i learnt after joining college. it all began when i was given three super crazy roommates when i joined. Those three turned my world around. Everything they had was expensive, at first i thought they were from  rich families but turns out they weren't. They transformed me to a  naughty girl in a flash and soon i was in their bandwagon. The first  thing they introduced me to was weed. I grew up being taught the harmful effects of weed n i hated it with all my heart until those three showed up. weed makes one become open to new ideas, i did everything they did  I got into my first relationship with a fellow freshman. Had sex for the  first time with him, from there i became a sexual beast. On second year we rented a  room 3km from campus. we did everything in that room, sometimes smoking and drinking. Flirting with lecturers to pass the exam is a norm to me. my GPA is among the highest in class, i will graduate with a  first class honors come next year. We have been sleeping with older richer men for money. After school i will start my own fashion boutique because i have the capital to start(this men got cash). since this is an anonymous platform, i would also like to add that i've had two abortions in a period of two years, am not proud of that or myself.

It pains me when i think about my family back at home who see me as a role model to my siblings n are glad am going to finally make it in life of which i know i've used the wrong road. If i could have a do-over, i wouldn't follow the path am in now. If parents only knew what most of  their children turn out to be in campus. Anyway that's my confession.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.8752050995826721

  Its funny how everything reminds me of you. Songs, books, odors, even words. Not even big words like love , soulmate, twin flame but simple words like ""always"" and ""happy"". It feels like even the universe regrets breaking us apart. Of course it will regret it. But you know, I have actually moved on. The first few days, I even hated That I had to breath. I hated everything, everyone but then, I remembered how strong u were leaving me behind. I knew I wasn't helping anyone by being like this, so I decided that I had to get up and live. Or maybe even ""fake it till I make it"" I tried to kill the part of me that felt like I couldn't live without u. I did, I killed it And I lived. But I never got you out of my mind for a moment. I knew it was my gravest mistake and that I would be forever resentful but it was too late already. U had left. U had left me there, begging, crying. You were stone cold and that moment we were video calling I knew you'll never feel the same way about me again and I won't be to you what I was. I'd check my telegram often to see if u have checked upon me within a few days time sometimes u go days without checking. U wouldn't even check if I sent u text. You really were sure about this. This was what u wanted for us. But I never got tired of waiting for texts or missed calls or I don't know last Seens. Often there were none but sometimes I'd see that u checked in a couple of hours ago and that would anger me again. I hated how I was so weak when it came to you. I hated how a simple ""baby"" would make me forget everything u have done and said. Even the fact that u checked upon me, would lighten me up. But again it also angered me, it was like u were holding me. You wouldn't let me be with you, neither would you let me go away too far. That was really harsh of you. You wouldn't let me leave this behind and move on.....that's what I thought a month ago but I'm now I'm back to square one. Learnt you still feel the same. But look, I don't want u to hurt because of me or anyone else for that matter and I highly doubt the distance relationship would work for us.

It all started when a girl first texted me
Then we kicked it off, we talked nd we became close.
After sometime a convo started up ND she told me she knew my friend
I didn't feel threatened cuz he was a friend nd I thought me and her had passed that moment of betrayal
So I just played it cool. She told me that she feels really close to me nd stuff like that
IDK why but I got attached fast which I don't do fast
Then one night she told me that she got a new boyfriend. I couldn't believe my eyes. I asked her about it nd she said that it was her bestfriend nd that things just changed between them
I was hurt of course but I hid it but I still seemed bummed. She asked me what was wrong. I told her that I liked her, she said that she really liked me too but just she had to do this.
I said okay I can get through this if I just became her friend. She asked me just friends nd I said okay
But after that every text she sent hurt me every single one. She just looked past at our texts like nth but i felt it all.
But three days after she told me that she got a boyfriend​, my friend told me that he is gonna meet her.
I said good luck to him. Nd he went he told me that he had a great time. Nd they met again, they spent the day together I said okay
But like after a week she told me that she got a bf, he told me that they kissed​ nd that they started dating. That's when I realized that she lied to me. Nd I REALLY HATE people who lie to me. I said nth I told him to have a blast. But that she was dead to me nd never mention her to me ever again.
He asked why but I didn't tell him. Well now I have met her, both of them together actually nd I'm over her now. And I wish they have a good time together

Doesn't mean I am ugly and fat; it's just a comparison ). I was never the one the guys were after and I've always been cool with it. I honestly preferred being considered as ""one of the guys"".
But there's this thing I just HATE   when guys that wouldn't look at me twice on any given day when I'm with my pretty girlfriends suddenly start showing interest when they actually talk to me or when I decide to get out of my hoodies and braided hair and  actually flaunt my curvy figure. 
I am talking to all of you a**holes who thought I was a nobody. Nigger I don't even need to wear makeup  (never did my entire life) and I'd still look as pretty as all the other girls that did. Y'all thought I was shy and boring? Well I did notice that flicker of surprise across your faces as you realized that I was actually an outgoing person with a great sense of humor. Y'all thought I was fat underneath my baggy clothes? Well I did notice your double take as your eyes followed me across the room marveling at how I had a killer booty. Y'all even had the audacity to make a comment.
This is to all of you guys who went from ignoring me to noticing me to trying to get my attention. Seriously it's sad. 
I hate you all for it. I hate you guys because u made my little, innocent self blush inside and get butterflies because I was finally becoming the center of a ""cute guy's"" attention.

I always change the subject or laugh it off when a guy is trying to ask me out. It's not like I don't want to, trust me I'd like to have fun, but I have this fear that I can't recover from the day when he starts making excuses for not wanting to hang out.

A side thing in life is when you meet  someone who means a lot to you , only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go.

So my boyfriend is older and I got him to come to prom with me. Everything was fine and well until the next day. One of my friends (We were 7) was missing. We looked for her the whole day and we had my found her (And it was the morning after!) So I got really worried and I told my other friend to go to my boyfriend's house and get him to drive around looking for her since he was older and had a car. I went with my other friends and scoured the city looking for her. When I got back i find the friend I sent with my boyfriend with a bad expression. I asked what was wrong and she tells me that when she can knocking at my boyfriend's door, who else but to answer but my missing friend! In just a t shirt! The bitch has slept with my bf!! When my friend got inside, she saw my boyfriend eating cereal in boxers with bedhead. My friend slapped the bitch and she left to tell me. So a week later and that traitor bitch hasn't shown up to school. No matter, I still hated her guts. Anywho, that Saturday was TOA (taste of addis) and me and my fruends went and while we were just chilling, we spot my ex and the bitch grinding a little ways over!! How dare they show their face after what they did. So I got my guy friends who were with me to beat up that punk and my other friends took the girl by her hair and dragged her to where I was standing. We soaked her in beer and beat her up.

I didn't really like the idea but i just gave him and we started talking on other social medias. He...well he was insane, but in a really good way( not sure if that makes sense). Anyways we just kept talking, everything he says i was so into it. So if he doesn't text for a day or two, i never text first so i would change my profile picture so he would start texting me(i know there are atleast a few ladies here who do that...works everytime right). So he does and then as we kept talking i started to have feelings for him. It was strange for me cause i never had real feelings for anyone, well not for their personality, atleast not like this. Sometimes i would get angry at him for no reason, which i now realize is cause of the feelings. But the guy, i don't know how to explain it, every reply is makes me want him more and more. We both never mentioned about meeting up. Well there was a time he said he would do anything i want so we could fuck. But ofcourse i declined cause i'm the shy type. Anyways we used to sext alfo alfo but i kinda got uncomfortable with this one kink so i declined. Then after that he disappeared for a week( he's in college and in a stressful department). So after that i did something i've never done...i SMSed him. Told him i was worried. Seriously if you knew me this things would surprise you. Then after that i told him to get online. Then after everytime we stopped texting i would be the one starting the conversation. And he wasn't like he used to be. This is like 3 months into our texting. But still i kept falling for him, a guy i have never even met. After a while i got fed up of feeling like shit cause when he replied it was like i was bothering him so i told him to have a nice life. I know what i just said doesn't make sense but if i explained every shit it would be a book. So its been more than a month and a half since we stopped talking but i still can't stop thinking about him and i can't get every fucking conversation out of my head.

Nd that's hw it's always gonna be. U will never knw. Because u can't be sure abt ny body in this world. U can't even be sure abt urself. The only thing u can do is enjoy the moments u have with the ppl in ur life while they r still here. Nd the second is to do everything in ur power to make them stay. now ask urself ""have I really done everything in my power to make them stay?"" If the answer to that is yes. Then u have no choice but to let go nd move on. If it's a No. Then u have a Job to do. Nd if U think u suck at everything then it just means u haven't found ur thing yet.

Everything is is a matter of choice and decision!! Choose the right thing! If you think you are doing something stupid, it's most likely that you are. If you choose that and you say my life is messed up or something like that.....baby better wake up and make the right choice and decide!! Also girls, listen to me. We are wiser (I'm not just saying that it's a fact) so please be as you are. We should not be led by our hearts rather both by out heads and hearts. Look at your mother, your aunts or any other female figure you look upto. They do things after examining them critically. Be WISE!!!!
Boys, make a smart choice. If it's a relationship you want, a good relationship (even if it doesn't last, one tht you can enjoy) go with smarter and emotionally stable girl. Take my advice and you will see. 
And once again: people venting about relationships....yes love exists! Where? Who? Whn? I really don't know. But I know that the right person may not come at 16 or 18 or 23 or even 25. Just because you went through a bad break up and the person was an ass it does not mean that love doesn't exist. Also it depends on the definition of love you have in your head. Be real when you define love. It's not Cinderella story and all those movie types neither is it gonna be like your parents and grandparents because things have evolved. Also also..... love has a lot of components and the older you get the more you understand about life and love. 
So..... If she or he is not right WALK AWAY! It might be hard at the beginning but it will heal. Time heals.

Holding my mom. I said "" no take her phone and leave her alone"" but they didn't listen instead he took out a knife and when she saw it ... She told me to run ... But i couldn't b/c she's my fuckin mom ... He came at me and pushed the knife through my hand. I felt almost nothing at that time only my mom screaming and she was repeatedly saying run... Run... Run... At Tha time i knew they were going to kill me or something if i didn't run so i just keept running until i find help and people's on the road tot I'm a crazy person and just kept passing by.

About my mom. they killed her ... probably raped her too by the time i got back she was laying on the ground half her clothes torn apart and i couldn't believe my eyes ... I still can't ..


I'm sorry if it comes to the people who advised him as a shock but I have something to tell you.
---------------------------------------------------

The story that he has been telling you is not actually his but rather his friend's. His friend is very shy and he couldn't ask for help himself. So the only thing he could do is help him in this way ... At first when he asked for his friend's approval he said no b/c people might not understand it as it happened like his dad. But with a help of some other friends we convinced him to share his tragic incident with people who were interested in helping out. But another problem came his friend was not willing to use his account so we made a deal ...he'll change his username and Name similar as his friend's and I will post his username saying he needed help and he'll forward him all the texts he got to him and send back his replys back to the sender, filtering all the inappropriate ones because he didn't wanna take any negative comments.

After Secondary School..
Some of our classmates have gone out of the country,

Others have completed universities and are now
Doctors, 
Engineers, 
Teachers, 
Pilots, 
Lawyers, 
Administrators, etc.

Some have married, 
Some have given birth.. .
Some are dead, 
(Don't forget that too)

And others are confined in psychiatric homes.
Some are doing their masters programme, PHD, etc.

Some haven't even gained admission into the tertiary institution.

Some own companies, 
Some are now Directors and majority shareholders of huge companies.

But how do you feel 
When you meet your classmate, and it seems like he/she has reached his dreams 
And you're not yet close to yours? 
So many thoughts runs through your mind. 

How about the one you meet on the street wearing dirty rags and feeds on the refuse dumps and drinks from the gutters? 

Do you get the same thoughts running through your mind?

First God has not been fair to you. 
But don't forget some are also dead.  
Somehow feels like jealousy, its a normal feeling.

But, You must not regret your life. 
We all are different 
And our path to greatness
Is not same in distance.

Some might reach before you,
Some might reach
after you 
But wherever level you are presently, 
Please keep trying to break limitations and move further.

Celebrate the success of others, its an application
for yours.

Your friend buys a car now, 
Be happy with him/ her. Remember when you get yours, 
Theirs might not  be the latest again.

Life is not by competition, 
If not,
We all will be born into one type of family, 
One religion and same in everything.

Let the passion in you  never quench the desire in you
Keep it burning. 

What you pass through,
Write it down because one day the world would be ready to read it.

There's no height you cannot attain, 
Just believe.
Define goals and recognize distractions. 

Spend time teaching yourself,
Because the things that 
Mainly take people to the top
Are the things 
They devoted time to develop.

Don't be intimidated by your fellow's success,
The sky is too wide 
That the birds can fly 
Without touching themselves. 

Value the small things 
That God brings 
And comes into our lives 
And love God 
And do the work of God. 
For with God, 
All things are possible.

Now to those who are on top,
Never forget to give a helping hand 
To those who are down. 
Life is full of uncertainties;
The one you pull up today
May be the one to hold your hand 
To prevent you from falling down.
A piece of advice there.

May our friendship grow 
From strength to strength, 
From grass to grace, 
From zero to hero 
And from Earth to Heaven.

WISH YOU MORE SUCCESS
IN THE JOURNEY OF LIFE.

That important person may be ur mom, dad, best friend, sister, brother, a freak cousin or even that asshole all us girls complain about but it's love what u did with that asshole or the perfect guy or the family member u had or still have it's all just love.

But halfway into my first year, i brokeup with him. I told him nd everyone i did it because he hurt me in z past nd i couldnt get over it. But that wasnt the case. I just didnt want to admit it myself. Here goes the reason. I met a rude tall boy in my new life and i hated him at first but anyone could tell he was interested in me. But then we started spending time together nd i slowly started falling for him without even realising it. But i guess i was too late. He made me feel alive. He made do things which anyone would belive insane but i loved them. I was truely happy. He brings out something in me that i didnt know even existed. He annoys me nd i annoy him even more. He is honestly the only person who can tolerate my annoying behavior. He has more pride than i do and its toxic. I am fire and he is my gasoline. We are bad for eachother but we are worse for someone else. I dont allow myself to feel these things because building up a shell around you is better than being broken to pieces everytime. But he shattered those walls nd i didnt even know it. He made me feel wanted just to brake me once again.

2017-09-06 16:03:48,"This is not only a confession, it's an admittance. And it's boring.

 I'm a mean person. 
See, now, we all have a mean side that comes out at the worst of times. Here's the thing, I'm playful, friendly, almost unbearably sarcastic, understanding and so on, I could keep on writing about my good sides all day (not really); problem is all those good characters are for everyone but my family. It's like hey I'm a nice person you wanna see, haha, not you fam. My family gets the crappiest side of it and unfortunately or otherwise it's not even deliberate. I have a bad day, well no worries, lil brother is there to take a shitload. I have a good day, why not say vile things to the nicest mom out there. Is the smart cousin asking an innocent question, better start an argument and start screaming. I'm constantly angry or on edge around them. It's as if I get off from topping the mean scale of the day. Somehow, I couldn't get past the teen moody, be angry at everyone (not everyone in my case) phase.
Yes yes I know you think  I'm taking them for granted. Maybe but I don't think so. I'm grateful to have them, I really am, cos I feel shitty after acting out like a teenager everday and tell myself just STOP. But then I decide to show how grateful I am by being a self absorbed asshole. (Geez boy, does that sound like an abusive partner who acts all sorry after inflicting pain once again). So another analysis of mine is that I'm actually entirely mean and none of my friends (or strangers) know that because the comfort zone is only for family that won't abandon you no matter how shitty you are. Analysis three is I'm angry at them subconsciously but subconscious isn't saying much (for the record it's a very functional family even with the dysfuntion of mine).

2017-09-09 12:18:03,"Love being not kept in the loop with the simplest things. Like one text is all u gotta send & I don't gotta stay up waiting for u 2 call.

It's bullshit that I can't have friends because they haven't met u yet and I know you'll be salty yet u can go out and have fun while I'm miserable everyday. At least u have a friend. I can't hang out with people in my class and they make me really happy because I feel like I can only be where u approve of and I can't go places without asking u first and what's the point when u don't answer my texts until hours later? There's nothing more embarrassing then saying ""wait let me ask my boyfriend"" to go out and eat lunch. But if I didn't you'd get suspicious and things won't ""add up"" and don't say u won't act that way because I know you will because I know you better then you know me.
If something comes up that I've had to deal with before I know how you'll react if I said or did something. Yet you keep saying and doing things that you KNOW makes me uncomfortable or pisses me off or makes me in a bad mood then get mad at ME?

It's not fair! You can't push my buttons then get mad when I cave in. It's not fair. It's not fair that I don't know how to talk to people or make friends because right in the prime of my social life, right when I was learning to socialize, you came into my life and not a year and a half later I'm depressed and my anxiety is back and you're not even trying to help me. And if you do ask ""how can I help"" and I say idk u get mad at me. Saying ""how do u expect me to help u if you don't tell me how!""

I'm lost. I've lost myself while trying to love you and I can't find her again. And I feel like I can't say anything to you because you'll get mad or flip it on me and say things I've done wrong even though this I'm not TRYING to point fingers it's just how I feel.

Do you not realize that 99.8% of my life revolves around you? So chances are if something wrong it's because of u because that's all I do or think about. So when you don't text me back for hours, yet blow up my phone if I don't answer a call I wasn't expecting so I wasn't near my phone, yea it's gonna build up til I explode. Idc what you say that shit hurts me. It's not about how you ""sometimes text first"" it's about how when you don't text back all day, yet expect me to answer u in less then a minute. Then when I do I wait for hours for a response.

Like Louis CK said, ""if someone says you hurt them, you don't get to decide they don't."" Then flip shit around on me because what I say makes you feel guilty. I'm too scared to say it to your face but maybe if you feel guilty it's because you know you're wrong. If you're feeling guilty most of the time then change how u treat me.
You used to write me notes and text me all day and talk to me like I was the stars in the sky but now I feel like shit on your shoe not even worthy of a text or attention.

And I need attention. Yea I said it I need attention. I'm an only child, but I'm an only child who's mother is working her ass off providing and sleeeping when I got home and wanted to play. I'm an only child with a father thousands of miles away who promised me for as long as I can remember that he would stop smoking cigarettes for me, yet still smokes to this day, and made me feel like he didn't even love me enough to keep a promise to his little girl let alone live long enough to see her grandchildren.

Yet you've broken more promises then a glass thrown on a floor. Actions speak louder then words but your words are shit and your actions are even shittier.

You always said how lucky you are to have me and that I'm the only good thing in your life yet you never try to keep me. I'm trying hard to hold on but i don't want to be in a relationship like this. Idk maybe my expectations were too high. I grew up watching and reading love stories and wanting even just a fraction of that. I guess I have to settle for an occasional note and empty promises.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9954808950424194

This is for y'all good hearts out there. We all know it's not possible to please EVERYONE but you still try to please as much people as you can, you go out of your way and do it not realizing that it will soon kick back on you. You think the world lacks goodness and you try to balance the bad with you're good but deep down you know it's not possible and it will only hurt you at some point. So STOP. No one should be more valuable to you than yourself and especially not a whole bunch of the society some you don't even know. You're not any different from them all. You too have your shit. You too suffer. Why the fucking hell does it get so freaky when its someone else that gets problems and not you!?!? We all have our share of shit and you had your own.

I need advice. Ppl keep telling me that I need to be a lil less shy and a lil more outgoing. Well it's not like I chose to be that way, I just can't help it. Any time I meet new ppl my mind goes into overload and I end up being mute. I can't speak I can't even look at them. I will probably find a hiding spot an fiddle with my phone, which is super rude I now know. But texting or writing stuff is simple, maybe it's because of the fact that I can't delete and rewrite it like I did to this vent or maybe it's because I am not exactly using my voice but it works. Problem is I can't exactly meet ppl at a cafe and text them while eating some chocolatey delight.

It's my eighteenth birthday and I can do is cry over a boy. I have gotten to know boy over the past six months and he has helped me through a lot, from potential parents divorcing to dying grandparents to family drug addictions. He is always there no matter what time of day, even when I text him at 4 am he was there to help me (I was also there for him (I hope)). I don't think I was too needy. Since he goes to a different school I saw him once a month. We would have our nightly chats to talk about our days and if we didn't feel up to talking we had a sign so I don't think I was too needy. And if he needed me he would text. Once he was under the weather on the day we were suppose to meet for the end of the month but he can anyway just cause we wanted to see me. We had our little jokes for each other and we got along with each others friends, but we didn't start to become friends we met and instantly liked each other, so naturally we flirted and eventually we went on a date. The date is a horrible amazing story for another day. After the date which didn't go great but not worth ending everything for, I texted him for nightly chat and he replied but the next few days his responses got shorter until I gave up. Then two weeks after we went to a party of a mutual friend. I kept my distance so he could be with his friends. It casually chatter but he kinda ignored me. He got pet and would send me pics cause we would talk about it prior but after a few days he stopped and we went say to no talking, now a month later it's my birthday and he was informed a few times but hasn't said anything and I just want it to stop, the hurt.

I screwed up big time. I met what I believed was the perfect guy. He was too perfect though. Kept making me feel so insecure about myself because I was scared he would eventually leave me. I barely met him a few days and I fell so hard in love with him. But I never admitted it because I feared that I would get my heart broken. 

I personally believe in second chances. I screwed up badly to the point that he could never trust me again. We haven't gone on a date yet and I was just absolutely falling so hard to the point that I knew that I was gonna crash and burn and right now that's how I'm feeling. I wish he could forgive me for my mistake. I wish I could redeem his trust. I wish I could change the past. But I can't. I just gottal accept it, learn from it and move on. I miss him so much tho. I miss everything about him. I miss our late night phone calls. I  miss the way he would make me smile everytime he would say the sweetest thing. I love him....I know I do.

Once I met a guy, we have been talking more than 2 month and one day he told me that he loves me but I just said nothing he keep in telling me this and I told my best friend about this she told me to accept and be with him cause I may fall in love and when the moment I was thinking abt this a girl texted me... That he stop talking to her. And if I could make them together. When I asked her who can I call she told me her name and she is his girlfriend. I said owk and tell him this he talked to her and apologize. Then he said thank u to me. I couldn't hold what I want to say so I asked him to tell me the truth... Actually he is the worst guy he told me he loves both of us. By that moment I have nothing to say so I switched my phone for 3 days and after I get back I saw he texted lots of things. Even tho I was so angry I try to forgive and forget. He keep talking to me. He always make mistakes and I was tired of forgiving.  He always get so angry with tiny mistakes. I was tired of all this staff. After that I start living my life in different way. I stop caring abt any one except me. And once I told him to stop calling me with my nick name which he usually calls me and call me by my real name he said lots of staff but I said I don't care say what u wanna say and he said stop talking to me I did.

There's this person I've had hella feelings for, for a while now. But whenever I tell them that I like them, they like another. And each time my heart breaks even more. I gotta stop making a fool of myself in front of this person. She's so beautiful and kind and funny and adorable and perfect. She's everything I've ever wanted, but in her eyes, I'm not what she wants. And I understand why. It's because I'm ugly, I'm a dork, I'm fat, I'm petty, I'm not even funny, I don't look as good as the people she likes. I try so hard to be there for her but when I talk to her she seems so happy with another and talks about them and it hurts a lot. I just wish she knew how much I love her. I really do love her, so much. I wish I didn't though, because I wouldn't be hurting as much.

The worst part is, it seems like she enjoys my pain. Then it seems as though she gets mad at me for expressing my feelings, especially for her. I'm so sorry babe.

Hi. I won't say how old I am, but I'm probably younger than you might think I am. I'm going to tell you the story of my obsession (even though you don't care, this is literally just so I can vent). So, first off, my obsession resolves around creating accounts (usually social media) pretending to be someone that I'm not. But no, I don't take a picture of a random girl and say that's me. I use my face, but I change my name and personality. Out of all the social media accounts I have made, they are all fandom accounts, so it's not really ID theft (that's a different vent). Anyway, I keep getting caught with these accounts. But I keep coming back because I have made some very special online friends. It's so hard to deal with… I wish I could just have an account in peace that my parents know about. Well, that about closes up this short vent.",desire,NEGATIVE,0.9969634413719177

I'm a woman who has seen some ups and lots of downs but I'm naive as well cause I haven't used the knowledge I acquired through life. There's a saying that I love which reads Knowledge is knowing how to use a gun; wisdom is knowing when to use it and when to keep it holstered. Does that make sense? 

Okay after saying that, as a woman who has dated my fair share of men. I ought to understand some of their behavior and what's the hidden meaning of their words but I don't. 
I mate this guy who's intelligent, funny and kind, I'm sapiosexual BTW. I liked him but he was the first to say so. I didn't have strong feelings at first but then he started acting all hot and cold, playing with my emotions; I don't think he intended to do that.
We kissed which was magical and full of passion. I'm old school so that meant a lot to me.
After that, he said he wanted more and I told him No. 

I didn't say no cause I was a virgin, I was a victim of sexual assault when I was a lil girl and I'm still in therapy for it. I said No cause I'm afraid of sex and it'll take a whole lot of trusting that person for me to do it. 

After I said NO, he said he can't be with me cause he can't love me as much as I deserve and that he's still in love with his ex. 

I stopped all contacts with him but I miss him, I miss him a lot.

Should I call and tell him I want him in my life and he can hurt me cause pain is the only real feeling I know.

Funny thing is before that, when it was my birthday and her ex asked me out, it wasn't even a question I'd consider saying yes to. I thought they had this rule somewhere in the Girl Code.

This is not a vent but an advice for the girl that just vented but didn't have the comment option! POST PILLS ARE NEVER THE ANSWER!!!! THIS IS TO ALL THE GIRLS OUT THERE!! IT'S AN EMERGENCY PILL!!!!! EMERGENCY!! Read that again and again and again!!!!! EMERGENCY!!!! PLEASE!! Take care of yourselves and your bodies! At the end of the day you are the one who's gonna suffer the consequences!! Yes he might be there he might love you blah blah blah but you're the one with a uterus!!! You're the one that's going to be bearing the baby. 
Post pill has a lot of consequences if taken more than 2 times the maximum. And if we speak of the quality then even once is a risk. If you're sexually active go to the clinic (you can go to Marrystops or any other clinic that provides the services) and use one of the contraceptive methods! Also if u have a boyfriend TAKE HIM WITH YOU. If u cannot do this then honestly you clearly are not ready to have sex. Girls please it's not an advil or a paracetamol!! Whenever you think of taking a post pill better yet whenever you think of having an unprotected sex think of your future!! Think of all the possibilities. You are the one that's going to take the pill which is going to affect the blessing you have, bearing a baby. Post pill can affect you in a way that you can never imagen. Go research about it. Ask a health officers. Do not rely on the freaking pill. Respect your body and yourselves!!!!! Respect the future you are going to have and don't ruin it better yet embrace it!!!!! For the love of God just think for a minute. Again it's a freaking EMERGENCY pill and not a contraception method rather something to rely on.",caring,NEGATIVE,0.9931546449661255

Okay so im one of those girls who was real late getting into the dating game. My parents were kinda strict about going out in highdchool so there wasnt a lot i could do. I got into my first relationship in college. I met the most amazing guy... He was handsome, funny and sweet and everything else. But due to my lack of experience, i fucked that shit up. I had problems opening up to him, and i wasnt as supportive as i could have been. He was patient for a while but then we started talking less and less, we stopped seeing eachother and one day he just breaks up with me saying he just isnt ready for a relationship at this time and asks me if we can just be friends. I say no because he means too much for me to have as just a friend so we stopped talking. We dont contact eachother at all now except for the occasional holiday or birthday text. Its been about 8 months since we broke up and i have tried to put myself ouf there again but i just cant seem to feel anything with anyone else. i keep meeting a lot of guys and they seem interested and all but im finding it so hard to give any of them a chance. So what i wanna know is, is this normal? Is it supposed to be this hard to get over your first relationship?

And you covered my heart in kisses

Missed my tears, ignored my cries

You quelled my fears, you made me laugh

OKAY. SIT YOUR BUBBLY CHEERY BUTT DOWN AND HEAR ME OUT. THIS IS A DISCLAIMER. Yes, me and this person dated several times. BUT IT STILL DOES NOT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO CALL ME THESE THINGS. Okay here we go. So a few months ago, maybe over kiremt, this person started calling me ""a deserate attention whore who just dates people for attention, then gets people involved in my problems so they will feel sorry for me"". We will reffer to ths person as… AB. Now, AB here has set off many red flags before this situation, but I was just too blind and blonde to realize it. Fast forward to a few days ago; AB here thinks it's a good idea to ask me a question. And that question is: Why I hate him. Now I go off with a good explanation, and he tells me that he was like that because he couldn't trust me anymore. So I go with the most obvious answer to that, and that is asking why it is still acceptable that he should still call me these things.

I'm in an emotional dilemma. Everything seems surreal and I'm told not to trust people more times than I can remember. My life is full of narcissists I have no idea how to help nor I can throw out of my life. I'm being sucked in every moment if everyday but I can't break the chains. 
 I get myself into things I dread to please people and end up regretting it. However, I still do the same damn thing next time around.

As i said, i really like her, but she told me she isn't ready to date and don't like the idea of being in relationship... because she is worth it, i really want to give her what she needs right at this moment, which is what we are right now...

But far down the road, and we continue with this arrangement, my ultimate fear is, if her bf comes back calling, she will choose him and leave me.. that will certainly break me... who can compete with that history, huh?... but, if i pressure her into what i want her to be, i think she might get fed up and hit the door... i don't know what to do..

I've always sort of had a crush on her since I first met her, but I don't know why the feeling is so strong again all of a sudden.

I just got out of a relationship( I think so, atleast). U know it can be confusing sometimes when u think u have broken up several times only to find yourself back in the relationship. Yeah, for all those strong people out there who broke up with their bf/gf at one go... congrats!  u never loved them in the first place. .. anyways don't distract me, let me try and make my point. This was my second serious relationship(counting my first relationship that lasted 2 seconds when I was 17 as the first), unlike the first one this one was good while it lasted. I gave her all I had even if I knew in the back of my head it was gonna end one day because of this basic difference we had (Don't try guessing, let's just leave it at ""basic difference""). I loved her with all I had and cared for her, protected her. I did everything I thought would make her happy... morning texts, late night calls, kisses, cuddles,holding hands, everything and I didn't expect anything in return because I felt love was giving without expecting anything in return. And then the day came when we had to sit down and talk about our future and she tells me she had her guards up the whole time because she didn't wanna get hurt... the whole fucking year ke mnamn!! That shit broke me man!! She was protecting herself the whole time. Fuck!! How about me? That was when I was like this shit is over.... even if she started to be more vulnerable with her feelings afterwards, I replay what she said over and over again in my head and i said this ain't fair for me.... anyways I hope I didn't bore u... I guess what i wanted to say is that we (guys) also deserve to be appreciated in a relationships. Those asshole girls can't just take whatever we do forgranted & complain when we say FUCK IT, I AM OUT! They will realize what they missed out on once we are gone and hopefully will treat the next guy better. Let's do one another a favor.  Daaaamn!

I'm fucking stupid. I knew myself to be a good strong person that has a more versatile definition to life but here I am rambling to some bot about some stupid guy for the god knows how many time. Been with this guy for some time. It was never candies and rainbows we actually fought very frequently about the pettiest things and we broke up around 4 times so far bit we always found a way back to each other. I think I've adapted to us getting back together after the most fatal fights that I'm unable to comprehend that this time its over for good. Jeles is a narcissist and I need him far far from me but I always find ways to connect him to my unhappiness. Don't get me wrong, I am a happy person and I love life. However, when it comes to him I'm just a sadistic bastard with no pride. And this may sound like a hyperbole but it really pains. Physically pains. I'm just the black sheep and for reasons that I don't understand it kinda annoys me he is doing perfectly fine without me. That was all I wanted at first. For him to be okay ahun gn that's being one of the problems. I wish I could just be depressed about it for a month or so, just cry my heart out and at the end, accept the facts and be okay. Too bad its not going my way. I'd think I'm okay and out of nowhere he would hit and get me depressed all over again. I don't even how long this will be lasting. Fuccckkkk!!

So I’m saying this here because I’m too much of a coward to say this to you in real life. You don’t know this and hell, you probably don’t even feel anywhere near the same as I do, but I rely on you. There’s so much shit going on in my life right now and you have no idea how much it helps just to talk to you every day. We don’t even talk about whatever’s going on right now, but we spend most of our time on random stuff. You have no idea how much that takes my mind off of things, so thank you. It kinda stings a bit, knowing that you have eyes for someone else. Regardless of that, i’m going to do my best to make sure you and that special someone end up together. As long as you’re happy, i’ll do anything. I guess it’s sort of a ‘thank you’ for being there for me. I’m perfectly fine just being your supportive best friend. Anyways, I’ll always be there for you. I promise.

I think all the people in my life truly dont care about me
sure they’re there when im ok
but they freak out on me and abandon me/guilt me when i go into a deep depressive state
if there was an easier way to commit suicide, i would do it
i have no future, and i really dont think my death would affect anyone too long
my mother and father wouldnt have to deal with my breakdowns/spend money on my worthless ass
my boyfriend would finally be able to date someone who makes him happy and doesn’t bum him out
everyone else honestly would probably be glad that they didnt have to worry about me hanging around
i have no one to talk to without worrying that i’m just gonna bring them down too
and if i even dare to mention suicide to someone they always say ‘well how about how i’d feel??’
my entire goddamn life i have had to worry about other people before myself or else i could accidentally upset them and i was programmed to feel bad about every. little. thing i ever did to inconvenience someone
for once i want to be selfish and just not exist

You know that feeling? The feeling you get when life finally hits you with an epiphany? When u finally realize that you deserve to be loved and that you are loved...
Like the sun rises each day, like the wind sways the trees outside my window, as sure as the blue skies are dotted with light grey clouds, I know. I offer close to nothing, I can't shower you with expensive gifts, I can't offer u smart insight, I can't afford to spend all day and night with you. Be that a it may though, I still have people around me that care, I complained each day that people didn't understand or accept me. Through all those days I had people standing by my side, friends giving me a shoulder to cry on, two ears to listen.
I had taken them for granted because I felt unworthy of their love, unworthy of their acceptance. The voices in my head had out spoken theirs.
So I thank you, I love you, I appreciate you. Though I lack the words and confidence to say these to you out in the open, I want you to know whether I met you years ago or we have just spent one moment together, I appreciate the time you spent with me, the energy you spent for me, and the friendship u bestowed upon me.

Hello to anyone who is reading this! My story is a little complicated , I think.  I am in a relationship. Me and my boyfriend has been dating for 3 years now.  I love him, well I think I love him. I didn't love him back when he first asked me. I said yes because he told me his saddest moment and I couldn't say no after I saw him crying. I just wanted to make him feel better. Well one thing led to another and here we are in our 3rd year. 

So you might say, so what is the case here? Hmmmm... so I had a friend before I met my BF. And he was like everything to me.  I have known him for 6 years now and he shows up once in a while in my life.  When I told him that I got myself a BF, he became cold all of a sudden and I did not know then. But if he had asked when we were friends, I guess I would have said YES! But he did not  

So every time he shows up again I question my feelings for my BF. And  my friend, he is so cute you have no idea! And I am a woman who watches out for the simplest romances in a relationship. 

My BF doesn't necessarily give me any of that. But my Friend, he is so natural at it and I want to leave my BF and be with him! But then I second think it, baaaam I do not. 
My BF is a nice guy, he really is but he doesn't give me those goosebumps my friend gives me! My BF is a caring guy but all of the stuffs doesn't flutter me like those of my Friend! 

 I do not know if I should say this but even if I break up with my BF I am afraid anyone will want me ever again because I gave my virginity to My BF. Please you have to be in my shoes before judging.  It is not like I wanted to give him my V, he was so depressed one day( well he is always like that since I met him) but that day he told me he was going to kill himself and all I can think I can do is letting him kiss me. So he couldn't stop and I felt bad for wanting to stop him. So I stopped myself from stopping him!

Not any of my friends know this! They just know the good side of my relationship and I only show them that so when I ask them if I should break up with him, they told me I went crazy! 

I am so tired! And this secrets I carry are slowly killing me inside! I am not asking for any advices but writing this in Vent-here might let me off the edge a little! 
Thank you for your patience! 
And this is not some kind of copied and pasted story from Facebook. I really do exist!
 If anyone is going through anything that anyone around him doesn't know if I feel YOU! You are not alone! May God help me and all of us!",love,NEGATIVE,0.9618667364120483

I'm a 15 year old girl…
I don’t want to do this anymore. My life and feelings have just been thrown to the side my whole life by my parents. They make me do what THEY want to do, and not me. I’m not their puppet. I’m more than just something that they can control. I’m living, I’m breathing, I can think. I don’t want to be treated like this anymore. If I try to confront them, they’ll just get mad at me and tell me to do work, or to study. I’m always busy. Friends aren’t allowed after school anymore, from Monday to Friday. Mondays I’m always busy studying, Tuesdays I’m studying, Wednesdays I’m studying, Thursdays I stud, and on Fridays I’m studying. See a pattern? I’m never out of school. I never am. Saturdays I’m always studying, working. Sundays are for studying, working, and church. Whenever I go out with friends, I have to have a good reason for it, somehow.

I've been sick since that day but you didn't seem to care. Now im sitting here wondering if i should've just left cause clearly the people who care that much about me are few. I opened up cause you told its better to be heartbroken than not love. And so i did but then you shot me in the fucking heart and said it was my fault. Yet i still want you here.

Why? That's all I could ask myself . . . Why she want to end? I wish I know why if its me.. How could i ruin something that was so wonderful? Every day I would wake up and wonder how this could possibly be real. I was so insanely happy that I would become unsure on whether this was reality or a dream. But it was utterly real. I almost wish it wasn't because, in reality, there's never a happy ending.
May be many people think, ""That's not true!"" In a way, there can be a happy ending, but never truly. After all, we won't be here forever, and, once we're gone, the happy ending is gone with it. I just wish my ""happy ending"" wasn't so short-lived. It was not so long ago when we were playfully arguing about which one of us loved the other one more. And, of course, she ended up winning the argument. How did things go so downhill from there? Dose she just lost what she liked about me, she  say I dont this any more .. did she mean it . . . when she say it. Those words just kept repeating in my mind. How could she lose something so wonderful? I kow it because she told me she will never want to live with out me .. or did she just left it somewhere . . . I wish she just check her heart.. maybe she did ..Maybe it's there. 

A part of me wants her back . . . my heart tells me we will be  together till the end..  with her if we r not together right know  
I wonder how she is doing. I know she didnt lost her feelings for me . . . coz she love me  and love means ""LOVE is not LOVING different  peoples rather LOVING one person in different ways""  
""LOVE Means exploring new things everyday, telling them how much u LOVE them everyday, finding different ways to express ur LOVE,,,,,""
""LOVE is loving someone with out any reason unconditionally; if u find a reason to LOVE it is not a LOVE?"" 
""LOVE  is putting at risk your career, ur future,ur everything for the person you LOVE ""
""LOVE  is giving ur life for the person uLOVE wiz out hesitating; if u hesitate to give ur life it is not a LOVE""
""LOVE is living and LOVING the same person until the end of days and die""

It just feels crap how nobody even likes me, like I am just some sort of piece of trash that's easily forgotten.. it isn't enough that I am still afraid of blood due to seeing a kid get split in half in mid air hit by a car when I was 6 years old, all the bullying I've endured through all of my school years with people fighting me and even grouping up on me assaulting me and beating me up to near death, my father being abusive and having my ribs broken twice with me having to be rushed to the hospital due to internal bleeding, the facial epilepsy I've had for 5 years due to him punching me right in my left cheek, the fact that those bullies have broken my arm and dislocated my shoulder and kicked me in the spine so hard it hurts to even walk every single day or stay upright in a chair, the fact that I thought I could trust a person that I geniunely thought saw something in me and then just tore my heart out with what she did and how she's treated me.. up to what point do I have to endure all of these thoughts, I've tried to kill myself 4 times, once with bleach, other time hanging myself, cutting up my arms 56 times collectively and wanting to jump off a building but never actually went through with it just because I'm way too fucking much of a pussy to do it.. I thought I could trust people, learn to love and try to at least enjoy life like a normal human being, these days I don't feel like doing anything besides staying as far away from everyone as possible. I don't feel like eating or sleeping, I'm ruining myself even more as each day passes and I hate the fact that I can't even be called a person anymore, cause nobody sees me that way.

So I cut them off. I was done. But tbh I'm a super forgiving person so after a few months they wanted try again. It was good for like a month but now they just all act so distant. Like I'm a bother. Anytime I try to talk I either don't get an answer or they reply and they are obviously not interested in talking. I don't want to cut them off again. Because I'm already SO lonely.

I am drawn to broken hearted people. Every time I meet someone new,  they're either broken or completely damaged. I always find myself trying to help those kind of people. I always try to find ways to mend them and give them hope when I don't even have for myself. My mom keeps telling me to stop doing this, she says it's not in my power to fix every fractured soul that comes along. Maybe she says this because she sees how much I'm sacrificing to save someone's future. It's like with every soul I try to mend, I leave pieces of myself and in the end I become the one that  needs saving because once healed, they throw me out of their life like a smoked and finished cigarette. I'm used to being used. But sometimes I want to have friends who values me as much as I value them. I can't save myself, it's clear I've drained all the energy I have radiating for others.

This is for all those going through invisible disease. It is already hard enough. Don't make it harder. 


Putting the last spoon 
on the table, she smiled
He may not know, but
the one thing she tried,
was to make the day a good one.
With no reason to shun 
away the good times.
Alas! He bought it up again
""You gotta loose all the gain""
Her eyes welled as she spoke
""Its not in my control.
It hurts even to try.""
""You don't look sick"" said the voice of cajole.
""So do not cry
Eat healthy. Run more
Its in your head I am sure.
Where is the swelling? 
Why you take pills? 
There is no telling 
How long can we pay bills.
You are not sick. Just being lazy. 
Get back your old self. It's  driving me crazy.""

She sat there in disbelief.
The one person meant to understand
Refused her any kind of relief.

Must alone walk.

Hi there so this might be a little shallow and whiny, because my problems aren't what u would call life altering, even tho in some way they have altered my life. I have great friends who care about me and a family which upto some level is sane. I haven't had a traumatic experience that has broken me or changed my personality. My problem is one thing my self confidence, I am the most approval seeking person I kno, I need recognition for everything I do or my head turns to the worst case scenario. Is something isn't good then I immediately feel it's the worst achievement ever. N it gets worse wid romantic stuff, I think I like a guy and I get close to him and flirt then when I see he likes me back or something I immediately turn off and find myself regretting meeting him.

Let's start with the Truth. 
You feel you were given more than you can handle... You feel you've been dealt a bad hand. You feel you can't take this on your own. Well truth? You can't... You ARE given more than you can handle... You wont be able to keep yourself intact and still take everything head on... ALONE. That word (alone) is very important. 
We as people need help... We are co-dependent... We rely on one another to keep each other from falling. Truth. 

Consider this though... How can I keep you from falling if I'm not strong enough to stand on my own in the first place. If I'm looking to YOU to keep me from falling, how can I keep you from falling. I can't. Truth. 

Consider this... You and I just started ice skating... What do we do... I hold on to the bars at the edge.. You hold on to me and then we slowly start sliding. If I let go we might go on for a few but the second you slip I'll slip as well. So I need something stronger than YOU to hold us up.. Something rooted to keep me from falling and to keep you from falling. Truth. 

Consider this... Now we're moving together... I'm rooted and were up and going slow and steady. Now if you slip I'll almost always catch you but you'll slip a whole lot cause your only holding on to me and we know by now I'm not enough to keep you up and straight. I can only keep you barely up. So what do I do... I pull you and let you grab hold of the bars. That way we'll both be firmly rooted and now we can work faster for we are not limited by each other. Truth. 
We can how ever still go together... I could hold your shoulder. We could laugh... Tease and just have fun. Will we slip still. YES. Will we fall...NO. We're TOO secure for all that. 

Here's what I'm saying... I am merely human. I am not able to save you. I am not able to cure you. I am not able to be your rock or your anchor.

We miraculously happened out of thin air 
No seriously.. Thin air cause thats what the big bang is

Why is it easier to believe something created itself 
Than it is to believe that there is a creator

Do you assume it sprung into existence 
Assume its all but mere coincidence

You say it's logic that's on your side

Where do I begin? I don't know what to say but she is the most beautiful person I have ever known. I love her very much with all my heart, and it breaks me to know that after such a short time together we must be parted. It was truly the happiest time in my life and I hope it holds the same significance for her, as it did me. It will be tough for both of us but she is strong, stronger than she know, and I hop she will be okay with time.

There are too many memories to simply write down, from the smallest thing we do to the most childish moments, to the most intimidate like reaching for her in the dark and the simple act of holding her hand while walking across the street. They are the moments I will treasure. She has helped me in so many ways, from the smallest thing to the largest. From the simple act of helping me conquer my self and my share of weaknesses. I can never thank her enough and my appreciation goes beyond what I can express.

She one of the kindest most loving people, I have ever met and it is a rare quality. I am so glad to have experienced it for even the shortest period of time. I would have been glad to experience any length of time, whether that be short or long.

Her generosity seems to know no bounds and I truly hope she will be ok ... and also I wish she get back and try to be with me... I hope with all my heart she will be happy. Where ever she end up she is gorgeous in looks; personality, mind and I know she is the most worthy to me..

It feels strange writing this. It is surreal; the idea she must leave seems distant, unreal almost. But as I write this it is sinking in, my hand is going numb. I feel small and scared. I don’t want her to leave. Every fiber of my being says this can’t be real and this isn’t happening. I want to stop it, but what can I do. Uffffa how I wish she could stay. I would give up everything I have for it.

How can I say me and her are not together? I can’t. I won’t. I can’t say it here; it is beyond me. I am tearing up here and my friends are staring and laughing at me... but i dont care... I feel no shame in my love for her. I love her with all my heart",love,POSITIVE,0.9956497550010681

You might call it crazy, my love right now, those who are reading this will curse at me saying that ""love is only with one other person"". But I can't easily love one person.

We are the poorest generation. We're poor, Not in money but in life. As i look around, none of us are able to live in this very moment; and those who claim they do are only fooling themselves by binge drinking, sex and ""over"". All we do is dream of a rich future but neglect the present. We spend our times on our phones and in our beds, but still wonder why we feel that sense of impending doom in our stomach. We've never done anything that's worthy but instead blame our parents for all the bullshit that has  happening in our lives. Its also sad that our friendships are at their most intense only when we take selfies for instagram and when we wish them happy birthday on facebook. It's rare to see friendships that are more than just cheap words of affection.
It's even sadder that we talk a lot of shit about the shitty state of things but don't do nothing to solve things. We applaud people who are experts at sarcasm but pay no attention to the doers, the ones that get thier hands dirty. We talk about cars, cribs, mawreding bottles...  but we cant lift a finger to do the boring job of earning a living. 
This days a guys sense of worth comes only from the number of women he slept with. We celebrate the player but never the loyal one.

Iv been reading the vents here for a while now..its high time i had my say.                                              1. life is a bitch it will fuck u one way or another so suck it up..no one gets out of it scratch free so its up to u..can either wallow in  self pitty or grow z hell up.                                                                        2. Rember everything is temporal..happy, sad, depressed anxious, jelous, in pain whtever it is u feel trust me it will pass.  be willing to take the sweet with the sour. Whoever told you it was gonna be all roses and rainbows lied to you.                                                                         3. All you people whining about realtionships stop relaying  on other people to make you happy ..if ur not happy alone no amount of loving can make u happy or secure learn to be a whole indvidual by yourself first. If u dont enjoy your own company no one else would.                                                4 .stop being so scared of being hurt ,relationships are messy. People are just faulty beings who will let u down eventually. if u cant accept that then you arent ready for a grown up relationship so take a break for a while.                                                             5.ladies, men will only treat u the way u let yourslef get treated so say no to people who degrade you treat to like you are meat..ur too good for that shit..men are drawn to confidence so own your shit  nothing sexy abt baggage or insecurity so sort your shit out first.                                          6. Lets face it no one will care about you like u care about your self so learn to be your own bestfriend.",caring,NEGATIVE,0.9986716508865356

I don't really understand y religion is not allowed I mean don't look at it like people preaching u they are just sharing what they know. Me personally every single good thing I have is because of God. All the reason I passed all the hardships of life is because of him so the only way I can advice you is by telling you how I got through the situation the only way I know is through God. And nobody is mentioning one religion and denying another. The people are just saying putting your trust on a higher power than your self. Y do you all assume that one religion is trying to convert you into something else. Whether on not you take those people's advice is up to you but denying people the right to say what they feel is wrong. And you know how wrong the world is when there was no vote to band the talk about offensive people to one culture or sexuality but there is a vote to band talk about God (not even religion, cuz I didn't read anyone talking about this religion).

She is so open it makes me feel like a fraud.
I sometimes act like a total dick, and just when i feel a little relieved that she was done with me, she comes back demanding an apology. Unsurprisingly, i give her one.
Everytime we go out, i would pray that one of the rich, handsome tall guys to just take her away. But she is annoyingly loyal. It's so hard to keep up that ""i don't mind if you go face"" for such a long time.
I don't know if its because of my previous relationships but I'm always anxiously waiting for the end, for the curtain close.

What started as a simple experiment two years ago, has now become a way of life. This experiment reached its peak when i finally told my parents that I'm dropping out of medschool. I think, by now you know what I'm talking about: facing my deepest fears.
Like most people, i lived most of my life in fear and the fact that i grew up in a family who confused respect with fear didn't help at all.
I grew up to be a guy who always tried to be a "" tiru lij""
I grew up to be a good liar because i knew that the truth might bring punishment with it.
There was also this passivity that came with this type of upbringing. I started to forget all of my dreams and started going the safe road( the road every so called gobez temari is forced to choose), and told myself that if i fail at least it's not because of me, it's because of my parents( i know it's a sick idea now).
Fortunately, as i grew older i started to examine my life, educate myself, and build my confidence through action.
Week by week the fears that plagued my past got weaker and weaker
- the fear of what people thought of me
- the fear of losing the approval of my parents 
- the fear of being poor cuz i chose to follow my dreams
- the fear of confrontation 
All this fears eroded the more i gave my self into action and educating myself.

We were a rerun of most love stories, but we felt special. Blinded to the tsunami up head. I was raised to be emotionally  closed off and she was raised to be passive aggressive.
When we first met, it wasn't love at first sight cuz all i saw was how other boys were looking at her and i thought to myself she'd be a good chase.
And she was acting all cool cuz it's what the other cool girls were acting like.
Got her number. Texted her. Texts got intimate. We met up. Got tipsy. Got frisky. 
Repeat a couple of times.
Then with out us even deciding we were a thing our friends started treating us like we were.
So we went with  the flow. And for a time it went great.
Soon i started to notice that she  had such a potty mouth. I tried not to hear most of her disgusting sidebs. 
She inturn found out that i wasn't as emotionaly invested as she was in this shit.
I started to get frustrated because any little disagreement meant i wouldn't get any that night. That was her greatest instrument of manipulation. And me being the way i am angered her even more by not showing my frustration and my need for her company.
Soon everything turned into kurfia, dry spells, and thoughts of what it would be like if i was with that hot girl in my class.

Vent#2
This is not a vent just need another perspective.
RECAP of my previous vent: 
· I met this chick at a party we hit it off got her number, even though i wanted to, didn't call.

2- our meeting went very well, we probably will meet again.
3- There are other girls in my life at the moment.

3- I don't know why I feel bad bout cheating on her, is it even cheating? Since nothing is official. 
4- I don't know why am putting in so much thought in to it.",confusion,NEGATIVE,0.993873119354248

I'm a girl that isn't really comfortable with who she is because I'm slightly thicker than my friends. My friends would always say ""your boobs are too big"" and it would make me feel insecure about my body. For a long time, I thought no one would ever love me, or fall for me. Two months ago I met my now boyfriend. I love him too much and I am attracted to him, but it feels like a chunk of me is missing. My sexuality is always a mystery because I am attracted to males and females , but I don't want to label myself as bisexual. Ik there will be so many people against this but,

Vent #3
This is not a vent just need your perspective...
Are we supposed to forget? Are we allowed to forget? Are we allowed to remember? Can we just move on? About the ones who have walked in and out, about the ones who didn't want walk out but who did any ways, the ones we push out, the ones who have fallen, the ones we walk out on.
 Forgetting is like Letting that person who really mattered cease in your mind, there is no more of them... It's like they are just gone. ""Out of sight out of mind.""

What makes us cry is when they die the odds of seeing them again drops to zero, that's what sad about the whole thing we don't cry cause we loved them, we cry cause we are bound to forget them, it just varies from person to person how long it takes. It doesn't really matter how much we love them or how much we really care, we have to forget. For our sakes and for the sake of others around us. For the weaklings that don't want to remember who don't want that burden of remembering, we don't want that tiny but heavy pain of remembering, like others don't have it bad enough. We are weak selfish creatures who want happiness at the expense of others but don't want to feel the pain, the pain of remembering.
 If we don't forget, society brands us ""mentally sick"" or worse. Cause people always want the easy way out, they don't want to remember and they will hate you for it if you make them remember,so moving on is how we comply with their rules. We are supposed to forget after we cry.The whole point of crying is to get it over with crying is a shortcut it's supposed to make us feel better,crying is cheating. I feel like crying deprives us from our true grief,remembering. 

I believe true grief is remembering,  true grief is savoring ever little moment, cherishing every memory. Remembering is the best thing we can do for them, keeping them with us, keeping them alive when they are dead, keeping them close when they are far.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.996460497379303

This days it's frowned upon to say that someone changed you( cuz the only real change comes from the inside) but by God did she change me.
I'll never admit this to her cuz my ego cant handel her gura.
It's amazing how she saw something in me when i was still an entitled badass wannabe. 
For once in my life i started thinking about the future. I started taking my life seriously cuz i wanted her to be in it.
She is the only person i can have world war 2 kinda fights with and still be assured she'll stay. She's the only person i can set aside my ego and be cheesy with.

if anyone gets close to me emotionally i get scared. N i just push them away. I do it subconsciously. I'm just realizing this now 
Being open n trusting is a building block of any relationship. Um scared of hugs even. i just shout if anyone try to hug me or lean on me. I personally think the problem came from my upbringing. My parents were not close to me. Physically n emotionally. Plus they didn't allow anyone else to b close to me. So i grew up isolated. N i began isolating myself even more. So i think that's the root cause of my problem. I don't trust ppl cuz ppl n family fucked me over n over again. My family raised me to think that i am lesser than everyone. They stripped me of the basic necessities of a human. So sometimes i think like breathing is a luxury for me. It's not like um ugly n he's prettier or anything. Like on a scale of one to ten for just the two of us.  he's a 2 n I'm a 9. So the physical appearance is not a problem. If anyone does a bit of loving thing i close my wall. He says I'll call u up three times per day? I don't feel like i deserve all that attention. Everytime he calls i offend him till he hates me n stops calling. buys me gifts i don't accePt. cuddles me .. i just find a reason to escape his embrace.

I'm still in high school and she's is so mean to me.... I'm not dumb but im not brilliant either... She now also makes fun of my marks. And treats my mother like dirt... She is so mean... And talks ugly about us to my nephews... I hear all she tells them.... It's not like she makes a point to whisper... She is constantly putting me down.... She doesn't like me to shower first or dish up first before the children and that's fine... She calls me a failure and treats me like dirt.... I try to be nice and she mocks me....

What do girls actually think of guys? I wanna know. Do they see us like this block of wall who has no feelings whatsoever? We feel too you know. We might not show it upfront, but if you look deep enough you'll see that at least some part of all us is capable of loving and being hurt. I don't want to generalize but bitchyness is increasing at an alarming rate.

You are a bad idea. And I know it. And you know it too.
Wanting you is walking into the devil’s lair; it is playing with fire.
This is wrong,
This is immoral,
This is everything I despise.
And yet here I am, still wanting, waiting, and watchful. You’re all I see, you’re all I imagine; a second moment doesn’t pass without you. You are always one thought away.
I want you to kiss me, to feel me, to caress me, to hold me, to touch me in all the ways you aren’t supposed to admit. You are such a bad idea.
I think of you and my breath escapes me a second at a time. I feel suffocated and violated and beautiful and stupid and impassioned and hating myself because you are everything that is wrong.
You are the cautionary tale. And the universe looks at us and judges. We are a bad idea.
And yet I hang on every thought and every word. I want to be with them and with you all the time, and in this moment, I think, for all of time.
Maybe it’s the thrill, maybe it’s the never done-before, the ridiculous, the fantasy, the spectacular, the extraordinary. Maybe it’s you existing and me existing and us existing in this one moment in time.

We r best friends that grew up together but I have a huge crush on her and I've been meaning to tell her but didn't until now. Then one day I came from work, got in my room and i was watching a movie and when it got darker I saw a light coming from her room (her room is side by side to mine and I can see inside her room but she can't see mine bc mine is elevated) when I got outside to see, I saw her doing the nasty nasty on her bed and guess what? SHE SAW ME LOOKING AT HER. I got off my balcony as fast as I could and never looked back again for the rest of the night.
Now it's been 2 weeks and it's a complete and utter awkwardness btw us...we don't call, text, talk, even look at each other anymore.

Hey everyone. I have got something to say. If there are any nerds out there you can relate. I am your typical nerdy school girl who accidentally happened to crush on a really cool junior. Well that was how it was about three years ago. That same year I became friends with him. He was a really good one. But when he said he had feelings for me I totally lied about mine and kept him as a friend. I still don't understand why i did that i guess I wasn't confident enough that i could keep him as a boyfriend. Even though i refused to go out with him he didn't give up on me. On the eve of my birthday he gave me my first kiss. A kiss i was too startled to give back. Even though i felt my heart beating thousand times per second i still refused to go out with him. It wasn't until the nxt year i finally agreed. We had an awesome time as a couple. For about 5 months then i broke it off because i felt like i wasn't going to be the girlfriend he has always wished for. I wasn't skinny or tall or with a pretty face  i was the class nerd with glasses. I was the girl who can't talk to him over the phone because she's too scared of her parents. I was the girl who wouldn't let him hug her or hold her hands  in public  cause she didn't want people whispering how she isn't good enough for him. I was that girl he would definitely get bored of. And i let him go. I thought i knew what's better for him. Apparently i didn't  a year have passed yet he still talks about us. And now i am pretty lost  i don't know how i let my crush get this far. I don't know whether i truly like him or i am just in it cause i knw he likes me back. I don't knw why i keep thinking of him. I obviously don't know why i am typing this story at mid night. I guess i really am confused.",confusion,NEGATIVE,0.9933172464370728

So this is the story, I am a 24 year old guy and I feel like I am too consumed by the thought of having sex but don't put in the effort because a lot of girls I see want a serious kinda thing and I just can't keep up appearances that long just for sex,it's just not me.i lose interest way too quickly. So it's getting harder and harder to find a girl that is casual and is sexually active like me. And the frustrating part is that I am gifted in that department size wise but not nearly enough girls get to see that without wanting other emotional things which just doesn't appeal to me. And a lot of girls around the office or in my neighbourhood think I am very light skinned and decently handsome but I am baby faced so is that the reason girls dont want a quick sexual encounter?

I think that this guy likes me. he likes touching me, hugging me, he always looks at me when he thinks I am not looking … especially my lips and around my neck and collarbone. He checks up on me all the time.  sometimes when we greet each other in the morning his emotions get the best of him and he holds me for a little too long and I can feel his excitement through his jeans. I like it. It turns me on. If I weren't too shy, I would bone his brains out right on the spot.
The thing is, I have a girlfriend whose heart I have promised not to break. I still love her with all my heart, but this guy is a god. He is Adonis.

For what they know don't exist

How can one miss sth 
They never got

Why do I always wave my hands
To signal you I'm struggling for a breath as I drown 
When i know you won't be reaching out

When I know u don't like getting wet on a cold day 

When I know am not worth
 shivers and sneezes 
The common colds and fevers

When will I  ever learn to drown quietly
With out a sound 
Without struggle
Just peacefully........

Have you ever felt useless, like nothing you do is in no way making you a better person, and you get stuck on the little things and blame yourself for everything that’s going on around you, even when you’re in no way a part of it, but still feel guilty.

Dear venters, I see some of you don't think homosexuality is not a problem and just wrong(as it is) but this generation is blinded by western culture and doesn't justify what he does or thinks. This generation accept everything as it is and doesn't try to understand or think about the consequences. I believe homosexuality, masturbation, drugs, etc are prison of the soul. I know for sure that no one feels good after acting in such way. He or she feels guilty and bad about it after. But once there in there is no way out(except by THE MIGHTY NAME OF JESUS)Because that is not our nature. So to everyone out there who is not set free from the world, I pray that you see the world for its true colors, empty, dark and joyless.

For all those people who are against homosexuality and think its unnatural, let me hit you with some knowledge. Dolphins have sex with the same gender for reproduction and African male lions also have sex with the same gender. So animals do it, and it isn't unnatural. For all you people that are against homosexual people, why do you care who they want to have sex with? Or who they love? Why are you sticking your nose in their business? Its their right to love whoever and to have sex with anyone they want. They shouldnt be out here being discriminated for loving a person. You all are being judgemental as fuck.

From most of those comments I got from me supporting homosexuality think that humans have brains and animals dont. First of all, dolphins are smarter than humans so technically speaking a sea water animal is smarter than a human. And you all keep on saying ""Its against God"" ""Its against the Bible"" well let me tell you something, you are only selfish enough to think about your own religion rather than others, just because its against your religion doesnt mean its against others. And on top of that for the person that commented about your babies and the people who you love, they cant be gay if they arent influenced by it and you can only be influenced if you let it influence you. So if you are gay because some else is gay, you let someone influence you rather you being who you are. For all yall religious people out there, you be preaching to God and Jesus and all but  the Bible also said ""Do not Judge"" and here you are judging. If you cant stay with one part what your religion says then you shouldnt be supporting the other. And yes there are people like me in Ethiopia, supportive people, people who keep the rights for love and equality unlike you pieces of shit who are only selfish to think about yourselves rather than how it would affect those people. All gay people did is love, and now since you are lonely and miserable and not lobed by anyone doesnt mean they have to aswell",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9926188588142395

Hello there, I know am going to sound condescending but here it goes for all the Christian's here I would like to say as a person who believes in Christ why would you hate on homosexuals, Christ has never hated the sinner he hated the sin, you should pray for them not scream at them that it's wrong because let's be real everybody sins in some form or other and God sees all, he sees how judgmental and intolerant you were to others.

What's up Guys,  what's really going on  in this Chanel when I first joined in this Chanel everything was cool and beautiful after that highschool and that office man told us they are confused about their sex life everything got changed and we lose all of the beautifulness of the Chanel within less than a week. 

You  religious people why are you judgmental why don't give a chance to people to do whatever they want they don't have a friend or family to talk  about this coz all of Ethiopians are hypocrite like you 
if you don't like the way this Channel is you can touch the leave the channel button, because of you guys now everything is about homosexual, so once again please stop arguing!!

He was broke then & had nothing just a dream i wasn't rich either. Then we joined campus & graduated. That's was a start up of our future. He got a good job & so do I. Look what I wanna say is our relation wasn't built on a 'thing' but on a trust & love. I helped that guy to become himself. He played a vital role building me too.he becomes my major part!!!

I am a university student, last year I got out of the friend zone . She was the coolest person I knew and I was really happy that she wanted us to date. But, after we started dating nothing was the same, she wouldn't pick up her phone or reply to my text. Still, I was supportive, I would send her jokes everyday just for she could have a happy day. And around Easter I wanted to surprise her, so I travelled 700 kms just to be with her and still she didn't reply my texts. So, I told her I came( I came to propose to her) and she replied and we made plans twice and she rescheduled, and the day before I was supposed to leave back to campus, she said she would come, so I cooked lunch and planned everything. But, she didn't come, she made other plans and she broke up with me( I cried myself to sleep) .

I did it. I cheated on my girlfriend. I had the most incredible experience kissing, nibbling, sucking, biting this guy (and vice versa). It was hot AF. What started out as a conversation about my sexual preferences ended with an unexpected climax. I feel ashamed. I am about to break things off with my girl. Venting while waiting for her to show. So, I can stomp all over her heart.. I wish she had never met me. I feel terrible about doing this to her.

Earth....yes..That's here.
That's home.
That's us.
On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there..on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast, cosmic arena.
Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.
Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner.
How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.
Our planet is a lonely speck in the great, enveloping cosmic dark.
In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.
There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate.
Visit, yes.
Settle, not yet.
Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand.
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience.
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image.

This one time, A supposed friend, a text buddy which blossomed to become a real friend started to get to me with her sweet words, with her seeking my attention 24/7 and telling me all and every aspect of her life.. I lost. Yes, I lost. We have been in a relationship for a year and a half. But It has now come to an end. She has hurt me badly, with unrecoverable wounds. I have paid for all and every thing that I have done. As I have hurt people, so have I been. This is what I want to say, be mindful of all the things you do. Because everything that you do will come back to you. Have you hurt people? Go and apologize today. Ask for forgiveness. 
Thank you.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9251883625984192

If I said to you, This life is a dream, how
would you prove me wrong? How would you
prove, without a doubt, that we’re not all
dreaming and that the true ‘life’ is
happening around our sleeping body in
another universe?

It could all be one giant dream that we’re
living out.. 

I'm thinking, and speaking to you, whilst
being aware that I’m doing so’.

Ooh. You can do that
in a dream. You can think critically, and you
can certainly make decisions and consciously
choose where to go and what to do in a  dream. 


 I’ve had various dreams where I’ve
been in another world, and there have been
‘different’ laws of physics to say the least!
Worlds where society works differently, and in
those dreams, the society and the people
within it all thought they were living in reality.

As you can see, proving that we’re not all in a
dream can be tricky. It’s unlikely that we’re
all in a dream, but you can’t prove we’re not.
Because almost all of our ‘laws’ and such
things are man made. Even the laws of
physics’ are only observed regularities in the
way things behave.

Infact you may ask how can we dream in a dream? 

The reason we dream in this reality is
that our minds are so powerful that we’re
able to dream within a dream, i guess so!

So how would u prove it??  Think it thorugh yor mind.
Its possible that it is a dream!!!",neutral,POSITIVE,0.5368757247924805

Love is just another temporary feeling. But the way it affects you, you would never see it coming. It will comsume all your thoughts. That person is all you think about, in the morning, when you eat, when you hear anything that could be linked to that person, when you do the simplest things, when you're about to sleep. Love is that feeling you'll have when you think your heart is about to burst out, it will literally feel that way. It's a feeling that could destroy you. It will change you, you won't know it though. And when it ends (because it will) you will feel that there is nothing left for you in this world anymore, because that love is all you think that exists. That heartbreak will be the worst feeling you'd ever experienced. You're gonna think that there is something stuck in your heart, that you'll want to literally stab your chest and pull it out. Endless pain, tears and sobs.... that's the tragedy of love. That's love.",love,NEGATIVE,0.9607269167900085

Okay so I have been reading a lot of vents of medical student and I hope y'all don't get fed up when it's my turn cause I really need to pick your brain on this (especially you medicos) 
So I am a pc2 student and I have had real doubts whether medicine is for me or not. I almost dropped out when i was in pc1 but I just couldn't bring myself to give up just yet so I didn't and I dealt with unimaginable stress to the point I was concerned for my mental health. And this year I decided I wouldn't go through what I went through last year and I have been working extra hard and I was getting good marks provided that the exam is a straight forward exam. But last time I had patho exam and I was fully prepared and what not. But the exam the professor brought  wasn't something you could just answer by reading a book it was more of a tease your brain kinda exam and I almost had a panic attack in the examination room. Not because the exam was hard but because I realised I really didn't have much settled and stored knowledge from what I have learnt so far. Been two weeks and i am so discouraged still i legit havent opend my laptop to study until now.The thing is I don't have a problem of working hard or staying up all night I have been doing it my whole life. Nor I don't mind spending my whole life sacrificing my life to others in need. If I am good at what I do. My problem is I don't think I understand the subject matter. It doesn't matter how hard I work everyone in the classroom is better at it than I am and I am not imagining this it's true. And I swear to God the feeling of being not good enough and the inadequacy is eating me inside out. I usually am the smart-ass and have a quick wit when it comes to other things but this.

I’m a 19 year old girl who’s been having a nightmares about my traumatizing childhood. I grew up as a only child, a bit spoiled I admit. When I was 12, my father got a job opportunity abroad and my mother tagged along the journey leaving me with my uncle and his family. There I lived with relatives. One time, my uncle went to work and I had to stay at home to study for my final exams. This distant relative came by for lunch and told the maid to buy groceries so I was left alone with him. Little did I know that this tragic incident would happen, I served lunch and sat Down to eat with him. But he forced himself onto me and I couldn’t fight back. He finished and told me he’d kill me if i told a single living would. I couldn’t open up to anyone. I hated my parents for leaving me there. I hated my uncle for having such a relative. I hated the maid for she covered up as she saw me in pain and blood. I hated everyone but even worse I hated myself for trusting him and for not saying a word. Ever since, I have trust issues with everyone. I didn’t have friends growing up. Even as a 19 year old I’m still scared of men.

I mean come on you have history, doesn't that count for anything ?    And from my general observation girls don't fall that fast. But when they do . it just....sticks!. Believe me. How is it fair that the two sexes are such polar opposites. Yeah,  and while you're at it ,why not share some of your secrets to forgetting so fast . I need feedback on this.

People of Ethiopia. I want y'all to understand something that's been a very serious problem of alot(and I mean alot) of people. I'm not writing this to insult people in any way, shape or form. But this is for all of our comfort, health and peace.

Please be hygienic. Like seriously, God only knows the amount of people that I have met that I could swear haven't taken a proper shower in all their life's. Like how are y'all comfortable with yourselves. I know we live in a pretty poor country and some of us are not that fortunate, but I don't think a bar of soap cost more than 20 birr. Your personal hygiene has so much power, like you don't understand. For your health, social life (no one wants to be friends with a skunk), the environment(I bet stink contributes to pollution) and so much more.

So I've been dealing with depression for a really long time now and these days I seem to be reaching my limit. I can no longer feel more than superficial enjoyment while doing even my favourite activities. I can't see the point of doing anything anymore nor caring about the outcome about anything I do. People keep telling me that things will be getting better and yet I've been fed the same lies for years now. I always joke about death but I don't think people realize how serious I am most of the time. And right now , I've never been as contemplative of ending everything as I have now. Easy , painless ways to just let go of everything. It would be way less exhausting than trying to survive in this world. And for all those religious enthusiasts out there about to tell me that Jesus will save my soul and I should just be more religious, please don't. I've heard it all before and you'll just be wasting your time.and honestly you'd do more harm than help. Well thank you all for listening.

So in light of giving some incouragnemet for my girls out there... listen, please do not listen to the barriers that are put upon you. Especially those cultural barriors, oh hell no!!!!! Speak up whenever you can and you want BECAUSE YOU HAVE A VOICE AND IT NEEDS TO BE HEARD!!! Go to places alone..., cafes, restaurants, cinema, swimming idk anything that makes you happy and can be done ALONE!!! Because you are complete as you are!!!! And girl you are BEAUTIFUL AS YOU ARE AND BETTER BELIEVE THAT!!!!!! I do not care the flaws you are going to tell me, because perfection is left to God and Him alone!!!!! If you don't believe you're beautiful say that and everything you think you cannot do every morning looking at yourself in the mirror and tell me if it doesn't change. And...and.... you need to discover and REdiscover yourself before allowing a man to be your other ""half"". Mind you you are not a half neither is he!!!(I'm saying this because some girls think that they cannot exist without a man in their lives and the whole other half thing has psychological effect). You are a complete person looking for a complete other person to live with, to love and SUPPORT you. YES, SUPPORT!! Not be supported but support each other. You are both going to be pillars of the relationship and later on marriage (if you WANT [Not forced by parents and relatives or the norms that a girl should not live alone crap...] and if he's RIGHT for you). RIGHT means... understanding, respectful, committed, honest, loving, caring and a person of communication. RIGHT is not money (don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong in having money, but girl YOU NEED TO EARN SOME TO SPEND SOME!!!!) RIGHT also does not mean looks (nothing is wrong with wanting a certain physical shape in a man but girl YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT BEAUTY IS SKIN DEEEEEEPPPPPPP!!!!!!) Also educate yourself on every aspect of life that will come in handy someday in life.. (be a whole rounded person, not just a Dr or a lawyer or just a business woman.... EXPAND YOUR HORIZON) like money management, communication skills, decision making technics, READ BOOKS (I actually would begggggg you to do this. Every book you read is going to be worth every word, note here to be selective), stay healthy exercises (the least you can do is walk, you know those power walks???? Yea those. You need to keep yourself healthy not shapy, HEALTHY) and read the Bible or Qur'an BE A WOMAN/GIRL OF FAITH (idk what to say to girls that are atheists---my apologies). I've a lot more to say but I'm sure some will be bored by now....yea... lastly, for now ,,, DO NOT LET A GUY OR WHAT A GUY DID OR DOES DEFINE YOU!!!!!!! YOU DEFINE YOURSELF!!!!! And also one more thing don't limit your dream to becoming someone's wife rather some body of your own, because you can do anything and the sky truly is the limit!!!! I'm done!!!

1. You are a female thank you and try them please and see if you don't see change in your life...

Okay,here is my vent!Took a lot of thinking to post this 'cuz i know some of u out there are going to make of this thing. Well,i don't care 'cuz i sometimes laugh at it too!...I have an OCD(Obsessive compulsive disorder).I have been having it since i was a grade 6 student. So more or less,it has 8 years i guess!...here is how my OCD goes. I love the number 3 and everything i do should be counted 3 or multiple of 3.Especially at nights,after everyone is asleep and i am the last one standing,i get really scared about not getting myself or any member alive the next day. So i do this,i switch on/off the light 3 times,i lock the door 3 times,i swing the door back and forth 3 times,i get up and down my bed three times,i put on and off my pyjamas 3 times and if it accidentally becomes 4 times then i will make it 6 or 9 times...because i believe if i don't do this and something goes wrong the next day,it looks to me as if it is my fault!i cant help it!My gut does all this....And this one i know it is going to be the most disgusting thing u have heard,but listen...once i have put my index finger in the toilet sink and then put it in my mouth 3 times yeah....My gut ordered me to do this...I really dont know what to do about this.I am really worried and I dont think it is going to stop!..What should i do about it?

So my boyfriend and I has been together for over 3 years now. I am in university in some other city he is in AA and I come almost every weekend to spend time with him and it was all smooth but he always wants a break up or a break out of the blue and that hurts alot. I love him so much I don't want to lose him so when ever he wants a break I give it to him and when ever he decides to come back I take him back with open arms.

Okay so guys we have read so many vents about sleeping around and stuff. Which is okay because it is natural and honestly we live in the 21st century...everyone is entitled to their free will of aspiring their sexual desire(of course when it is consensual with the other party involved).
But are we all going to the clinic and getting updated on our health status? I wish I could say we all are but please, this is so important. There are consequences to having more than one sexual partner so go get checked, DO NOT put your health on HOLD b/c you are busy or b/c you are ashamed to go to the doctor's office and say you have been sexually active. Doctor's don't care nor judge. But you should b/c your health should matter to you. Your future should matter to you.

So here is for my guys.. its going to be long so pay attention.... where to start.... yes, listen, Mind you,, you are not a half neither is she!!!(I'm saying this to u too because some guys think that they need a woman in their life to do the chores, mother sister then a girlfriend and a wife.. you can do all the cooking and cleaning by yourself okay). You are a complete person looking for a complete other person to live with, to love and SUPPORT you. YES, SUPPORT!! Don't feel obligated to do all the support in the relationship or marriage it's a 50-50 situation. Don't make her sucrifie a lot, don't make her sacrifice her family or friends. And most of all don't take her forgiveness for stupidity rather for her strength of looking past things. You depend on one another so cherish her. Also marry her for all the BIG reasons. Not just BIG boobs but big heart and personality. Not just BIG ass but big courage and honesty. Dont get me worng there's nothing wrong with big boobs and ass, but her inner bigness(if there's such a word) will go a long way. You also need to be less aggressive and more compassionate.. I mean embrace her, hold her hands,kiss her, call or text her at the most random times,be there with her thought all the small steps and hell yea better be with be with her during the tough ones. Aggressiveness was, is or never will be the answer!!!!!!!! And yes you also need to be a whole rounded person educate yourself on every aspect of life that will come in handy someday in life,more muscles on the brain rather than the body.. expand your horizon more than sports. Learn how to manage your money and time, how to communicate and how to make a decision. READ BOOKS (I actually would begggggg you to do this. Every book you read is going to be worth every word, note here to be selective), stay healthy exercises (the least you can do is walk, you know those power walks???? Yea those. You need to keep yourself healthy, not buff but HEALTHY) and read the Bible or Qur'an BE A MAN OF FAITH (idk what to say to guys that are atheists---my apologies again). On top of this when you get the chance to be a father, better accept it and be there in your kids lives. Give them a 110% of all what you've got. And when you get the chance to be a husband, be the best that you can and don't leave the house chores to her. Be understanding. It's a privilege to have her say yes, so don't you dare abuse her!!! I don't get how you cannot change the path that your fathers and grandfathers took. Be better!!!! It's the 21st century for the love of God!! Owww and stop it with the ""lekefa"", the "" if I have money I can get her"" and the ""I'm a player"" thing I bet you all I have no girl, with a proper functional brain, likes it,NONE!!!! As you can wear whatever you want and be whoever you want let her be herself!!! Lastly, there is nothing wrong with showing your emotions!!!! Be honest about them, we know you cry so why not do it in front of us??

Why is self confidence so hard to establish nowadays, you feel like your constantly being judged by everyone everywhere you go in these generation. Even when you keep your head up high shoulders wide and walk like a boss that thought of bieng judged still hunts you so you show that look on your face, that looks like the people around are your enemies all because your lack of confidence and fear of being judged. Why cant we just concentrate on ourselves and let who ever talk just talk and not affect as, plus its way more cooler when you walk high headed and don't give a damn.

I never forced her nor asked her too.

Am a dude and here is my story. Back in high school and preparatory school, I was a totally different person than what I am right now. Back then, I was active in every school activity; every single student, teacher, and administrative staff knew me; I was damn good with the ladies; and had lots of friends. But after I joined university, everything got changed. I started to lose it. I started becoming lonely; cut off my relations with the girls I knew; relations with old friends faded up; and I even got in addictive activities. I started chewing chat, heavily smoking cigarette, and drinking. My world turned up side down. Afterwards, I couldn't get things where they used to be. Now, I only have very few friends. My addictions have become much more worse; I've lost touch with my old friends; I spend much of my days in my one room castle just chewing, smoking, and reading. Its been even a while since I talked to a girl. I've never had a girl friend in last 4 years. Currently, the only good thing in my life is my education. Am dying here worrying about this. You guys have no idea to be in a place like this for a guy like me who people used to anticipate for the great. Am going mental here.

Even friends of them act like ntn happened. That disturbs me a lot n i hated her so much. Is it only me who feels like that about such kind of issue? Is it stn acceptable?

We kept bickering and it was so hard on both of us. I kept finding new sides to his personality and I was honestly done with his crap all together. But I still stayed cuz I thought of all the good times we've had so far. He made me cry so much. He ruined my confidence, my self esteem and my good traits. He made me petty,stubborn and jelous. Things were finally getting better but he comes over yesterday and breaks up with my out of the blue! U have no idea how angry I am right now. Had I known it was going to end like this,I wouldn't have tried to hang on for so long. I would have saved myself a lot of pain and misery. I'm so angry that he dumped me after all he put me through.

I mean...just because one pathetic nigga made you go through an inept  relationship that dont mean every Guy is the same.
Just because  you are clumsy doesnt mean whoever the guy you touch is poisonous...whenever a bad shit happens why do most of you act as if you are innocent? Why do your offencive act always come up with a ""not intended""? What happen to the ""AM SORRY I FUCKED UP"".? 
After all that you let the guy take the blame...lets assume a breakup happened ...then you curse on the entire male human n express annoyance.
After any sexual encounter with your boyfriend for the 1st time (especially if you a virgin) you go ""weyne"" as if you were raped or some like that....you both wanted it...you agree to it....thats why sex happened. But if by any reason you fucked up n he leaves then he took advantage of you n left you? Come on now .

This is to all of you out there repeatedly saying “ why do girls generalize? “. How do you think it feels to be let down repeatedly? You start a relationship heck even friendship and somehow it always turns out to be the worst thing you’ve ever done. It leaves a huge scar on you. When all the guys you meet just want to get in your pants, how do you think that feels? You could be wearing a potato sack but guys on the road never fail to look at you like some property to play with or they look at you like a piece of meat. How do you think we feel when our dads are not the best dads? All they do is get in late and go out early? How do you think we feel when we see our moms being mistreated by our uncles or our fathers themselves? Everywhere we go we come across selfish, manipulative and violent boys/men. We think we love our boyfriends and give into whatever they want or they make us give into it then they move on to the next girl. how do you think that makes us feel? I am not saying all girls are saints but instead of just complaining about us generalizing why don’t you work on being a good brother, a good son, an awesome and patient boyfriend and a loyal friend. If you are so different from all these crappy boys, then never fail to show the difference. we need to know there are good ones out there; to trust again, love again and just be ourselves again.",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9871770143508911

I have been in this channel for a while now. I have noticed that sex has become the god of this generation. Sex is beautiful and it was designed by God. But it was not meant to control every single aspect of our lives. We are supposed to enjoy it with our partners in marriage. I know yall are gonna think i am trying to act righteous saying this. But i am saying this with a humble heart. Anything you prioritoze, you give most of your time to, and something you think about everytime is your god. And if you call yourself religious or someone who worships a higber being, i want to tell you that you can not serve two gods. Whether you like it or not, sex out of marriage is a sin. Lust and sexual thought is a sin. 
We might forget this cause it has become very normal and accepted by the majority. But that is not the case. We are all going to be asked for our evil thoughts, sinful doings, and tresspassings on judgment day. We are going to be asked. Please let us turn our faces to God. God watches you everywhere. Be reads your desires and he reads your heart. And god is my witness, he will not be happy with these lustful thoughts. You can be a person who pleases God while you are young.

This is long..read it or don't...

When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims, religion. No contest. No contest. Religion. Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time!
 
BUT HE LOVES YOU. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, you talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!
 
But I want you to know something, this is sincere, I want you to know, when it comes to believing in God, I really tried. I really, really tried. I tried to believe that there is a God, who created each of us in His own image and likeness, loves us very much, and keeps a close eye on things. I really tried to believe that, but I gotta tell you, the longer you live, the more you look around, the more you realize, something is fucked up.
 
Something is wrong here. War, disease, death, destruction, hunger, filth, poverty, torture, crime, corruption, and the Ice Capades. Something is definitely wrong. This is not good work. If this is the best God can do, I am not impressed. Results like these do not belong on the résumé of a Supreme Being. This is the kind of shit you'd expect from an office temp with a bad attitude. And just between you and me, in any decently-run universe, this guy would've been out on his all-powerful ass a long time ago. And by the way, I say ""this guy"", because I firmly believe, looking at these results, that if there is a God, it has to be a man.
 
No woman could or would ever fuck things up like this. So, if there is a God, I think most reasonable people might agree that he's at least incompetent, and maybe, just maybe, doesn't give a shit. Doesn't give a shit, which I admire in a person, and which would explain a lot of these bad results.
 
So rather than be just another mindless religious robot, mindlessly and aimlessly and blindly believing that all of this is in the hands of some spooky incompetent father figure who doesn't give a shit, I decided to look around for something else to worship. Something I could really count on.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9663822650909424

Ah, so I tried to vent before.  My content turned out to be ""inappropriate "", an honest living and calling out to my kind.  But no worries, I've cut out some parts and trying out again, I would still feel better if the admins post my original vent instead of this one.  Anyways: here I am, an anonymous, in some platform, venting, trying to blend in with people I probably would never in real life. So i was basically  holding it here because i knew a lot of people will judge me. But am one of those girls you know, who have been fucking both man and woman, who don't consider beaututy, gender, race or anything. Obsessed with the old souls of yesterday, breathing fire,  Like those strange distance girls u sometimes meet in ur class.. Not that its a big deal but I lost my virginity for a guy and on the second day i had sex with my best friends sister. Why you ask? Why not.  I am protected, she is thankful but still depressed with life, she needed me to boost some perspective.  I am not a lesbian, I am not stright.  I am my kind who loves people because people are awesome, at least used to be.  At least my writing didn't use to be too PC or incorrect back in my days when we can speak out what we feel,  I was a  happy soul. Attractive or not. I love you all. I enjoy life as much as i can because why not. Advise me if u think this isn't the way to be. earth is a warzone but also heaven if u can alter ur perspective now and then. We are a couple of gods and monsters who are trying to coup up living together, with tons of insecurities under our ""Nike shoes, rayband glasses"" and our pretentious western perspectives.  We are what they made and not our would-be true selves.  But I tried to stay loyal to my kind, kept on loving and appreciating life no matter the odds against me.  

Please let's cut out of this dumb dissing, ununited, empty life and unite to love one another, support each other not becuase we are hot or shit but because we are humans.

I just watched a video where a guy and lady walk through the streets of Liverpool: him giving haircuts to the homeless and her treating stray dogs. The smiles on people's faces when they see their reflections in the mirror were priceless and it got me thinking...if two people can bring joy in these many people in single day why can't we all do that...but then I looked around to see the situation. We all are too busy working harder each day to find smaller groups to identify into to try and spread love. Ignoring what it would do to us in the long run. First, we divide ourselves based on religion: shunning those who refuse to believe in our truth...telling ourselves we are one strong unit...true, our big architectures and strict dogmas humble us and break our egos enough to stand together for prayer. But the moment we leave our churches and mosques we get back to finding those differences again. So comes race: tearing us apart into dozens of smaller groups. Then comes our political views, our sexuality, our social status (the 'cool' Vs the 'lame' ), out economic status (the 'rich' Vs the 'poor' ). There will always be one more thing popping up if we keep looking. We are arrogant enough to claim our way is right and ridicule others for their beliefs ignoring the fact if we only had walked in their shoes for as long as they did we too would have been standing in the same place right about now: following the same rules; defending the same values; wearing the same clothes; covering the same scars; faking the same smiles. Our beauty only exist in our differences and if their hadn't being no mind daring enough to challenge the conventional while everybody else was too busy following the rules we wouldn't have achieved any of the greatest things we did as human beings. So I say let's be a little open-minded. Even if our pride wouldn't allow us to admit that they too might be right let's at least have the maturity to let them make their own mistakes. And if we can't do any of that: let's call truce for some time. Let's call truce on our fights. Let's call truce on our judgments. Let's call truce on our smug remarks. Let's call truce on it all just to see what it's like and let's put all that energy to put a smile on a single face, to lend a hand for a friend, to sit down and enjoy little conversations, to build relationships and to build ourselves. Then if we don't like it, we can always go back to our wicked ways being divided with every issue that arises until we one day realize we're standing alone fighting battles from every directions without a single soul to have our backs.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9897448420524597

What if we could live each day from the place of knowing that we are whole, complete, individual sparks of the divine? What if we no longer saw ourselves as broken, damaged, traumatized? Who would we be without the stories of these wounds? Could we accept ourselves as beautiful - even if we are scarred? Could we know our worth even if we've been rejected? Could we love ourselves even if we understood that we've made mistakes, hurt loved ones, fallen short of our potential and missed opportunties? Could we accept that these things just make us human - and in the end, only add to our beauty? This is how I want to live!",curiosity,POSITIVE,0.5638504028320312

I have been an extrovert for a long time. I used to go out to parties, hang out with friends and families and genuinely enjoy their company. After a series of unfortunate events, I decided that people are overrated. Everyone is disappointing in their own unique way and some even more than others. I evidently became quiet at social settings because I started to think that none of it matters...in a way you could say that I became a Nihilist introvert. Now the only set of communication that I prefer is the digital one; texts and that sort of thing. Maybe its healthy, maybe it isn't I dunno. I know for now that I have given up on everyone and I just let things run their course in life.

Guysoch everyone needs to knw what infatuation is betam new yedegagemcut sry for that but seriously

Infatuation:a very strong feeling of love or attraction towards sb/sth, especially when these are unreasonable and do not last long. 

Think about it im not saying all u guys are infatuated but u cant be in love with someone u barely knw. Maybe ur in love with the image u have created of them in ur head. Infatuation is very idealistic. When ur infatuated u only see the good sides nd ignore the bad ones.

Am at a point where all i think about is my future life..like work and such(currently am a student  but i do some part time jobs -am very busy). My future worries me so much that i dont even have time for fun.   and am afraid of missing out on the dating stuff.

In my life, I see a LOT of good guys being played by girls. It's the usual crap, they get freindzoned, work up the courage to ask them out then get rejected with the typical 'I'm not ready for a relationship' or some bullshit. Then the guys get depressed and have to depress me too.. So I've decided to share dating rules that completely changed my life. 
1. Flirt LIGHTLY with a minimum of 5 girls(you know will never meet eachother ) at a time. It will boost your confidence and if you get rejected by one,trust me you won't give a shit. you still have 4 more :)
2.  Finding something you love to do which will occupy your time. If you are busy, you won't have time to waste on useless pursuits. It will also make you love your life which gives you a positive aura.
3. I don't think I have to say this, but keep your hygiene in order. Be on point.Smell like a fucking rose garden.
4. If a girl expresses, she wants to go out with you , then go for it. Don't get a big head just because you have 4+ other options.

5. Divide the girls in your life into 4 stages.
-> stage one: Shes just there to boost your confidence. You flirt with her but you don't have any real plans for her. If a girl rejects with 'I'm not ready for a relation...' or 'it's not a good time for me.' then this is also where you put her. There's no such thing as too much flirt practice, so put her time wasting ass to good use. Talk to her whenever you FUCKING FEEL LIKE IT. I recommend 5-10 girls.
-> stage two: She likes you and you are going on dates. Respect her, but don't give up your flirt game. Text/talk to her on the regular, she's earned that. I recommend 1-2 girls.
-> stage three: You and the girl are having fun and she's proving she's one of the good ones. Be good to her, surprise her with nice things. Stop your other flirt game but still have it ready just in case. Talk daily.
 I recommend only  1 girl.
-> stage four: do I need to say it? She is your queen. Don't ever disrespect her. Talk to her on the daily or whenever she needs you.Burn your flirt contacts. They have served their purpose. 
6. Don't bother your friends with girl issues because MAYBE they have problems of their own and SICK of your Shit.

I don't think that everyone knows what they are talking about when they say that they are depressed. 

Have you lost the courage to get out of bed for days on end and just stayed on it? Have you always felt tired and torn down to do anything? Have you avoided the company of anyone just so they don't see you in your tarnished form? Have you ever been incapable of doing anything small because you had that dark thought that deep down you know there is no point to it? Have you ever felt suicidal and actually tried to commit suicide by doing the most daring things out there? Most importantly, have you ever felt all of the above for a reasonably long amount of time?

 If your answer to all of the above is ""yes"" then congratulations you are depressed. Read more about it and Seek medical help immediately. You are not alone. There are people who can help with that sort of thing.

As for the rest of you fake depressed people, chill. y'all just in a bad day. That's all. Stop using that word like a mainstream justin bieber song title. Cheers!",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9980721473693848

Here's to all my fellow virgin guys and girls who think that there is something wrong with them or doubt themselves.... here is the thing THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU! I REPEAT NO FREAKING THING IS WRONG WITH YOU. Let's all take a moment and realize that every decision we make today will be affecting us no sooner than we expect. Excuse me if I do not want to have sex when I know that I cannot bear the emotional and physical baggage it comes with. And excuse me if I don't want to take no freaking birth control pills and what not and worry till my head explodes weather I'm pregnant or not. Also excuse me if I valuing my body and wanting it to be this way. Being a virgin is actually a blessing. Believe it or not. I just do not get it why people are rushing it. I'm a virgin and I'm 23 and I'm so proud of me. And I do not care if I am going to be 30 or 40 to have sex. Because I know it's going to worth everything. And it was not because I didn't have the chance to do it, but because I want to wait for the right time. End of discussion. Do not feel any less cool or not modern and whatever the freaking adjective is used these days for being a virgin.

This is not a vent...just a thought to encourage you. When you get too caught up in what people think of you,, or how bad you will look if you fail, you are at high risk of violating your own morals. Your intense desire to make yourself look good compromises your ability to stay true to yourself and, ultimately, to feel good.

ATTENTION VENTERS.. a long one but please consider...
Hope y'all are doing well...from my fair amount of time on this channel I have observed how little of you comment back. 4+K subscribers yet 3-20 comments on posts. What's up with that? The only reason people vent is because they feel the need to talk to someone and the anonymity encourages honesty. If you really feel the pain and indecisiveness of someone why not comment? Even if you don't have much to say a simple 'you aren't alone' goes a long way..so please guys, give it a shot. Reach out to one another.

It gets in my way of experiencing life, and i think it also affects my relationships(although there have been none that i could really say that i have seen what it is like to be in a relationship..but zats another story nd complicated) anyways i feel like i won't meet anyone that will like me face to face...i always meet new guys online, and if im with my friends i never even think that anyone is looking at me, if they comment i just assume that its not for me..just its really hard feeling like this..like im never gud enough with how i look..",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9969860911369324

who ever wrote about the depression stuff thank you so much !!
I used to get mad when people use that word suddenly like y'all don't even barely know about depression 
you might have a mental breakdown 
you might be stressed out for a while 
you might be obsessed with something 
you might have an anxiety 
And a lot more but it doesn't mean that you're depressed 
Depression is way more complicated its some serious mental illness that affects the way you think the way you feel and the way you act it can cause physical symptoms of pain appetites changes and sleep problems Severe feelings of sadness hopelessness and a lost of interest in activities
 it may even lead you to SUICIDE 
it can last long ( 6month - 2years)
So to pin my point y'all should stop using that word ""depression"" for no reason",gratitude,NEGATIVE,0.9988191723823547

I have seen some of u wrote that u are depressed and some even went as far as considering about ending it all(suicide). For those of you who have been having bad days and mood swings don't make permanent decision on temporary feelings, and don't use depressed as an adjective, because u are not. For those of you who are really depressed, remember that depression is just a state of mind, the brain is comfortable feeling bad so it just secretes the hormones which trigger depression.

How she thinks and perceives things and stuff.. way she talks minamin bicha she in general is amazing and she's the definition of my ideal girl and I started having these weird feelings whenever we text or meet up (you may call it butterflies but that's too ew-ish for my taste so no) I thought about telling her bout my weird feelings but I thought it would ruin our friendship and left it now 3 or 4 years passed and those feelings got even more real and idk what tf I should do.. even worse we act all lovey dovey arnd eachother now we even have these weird ass corny ass names for eachother now  and knowing how amazing she is it bothers me how she's not mine I wanna tell her how I feel but the same reason I didn't tell her 4 years ago is keeping me from telling her now I'm so confused on one hand I want her as a friend but on the other hand I want her to be something more so girls(or boys) if you got this far..

But my gf didn't believe me when i told her...and when she asked me if we could sleep together, I refused and she was like ""u don't find me attractive enough, thats why u don't want me"" 
 Girls, is it rly that hard to believe a guy is a virgin these days? I mean I told her like 100 times but she just couldn't believe it (bc of my past, I've had like 7 gf before her)...so I just can't take it any longer...

Well whatever comes out of my mouth is a vent. Since everything I say goes through a series of thought phases..

Well what I want to say is, this channel has turned the perspective I have towards girls 180 degrees. 

I now know that every look you give a girl has a meaning. Every word you say has a totally different interpretation. Most girls have a deep sexual fantasy they'll never admit. Every girl you think is innocent is NOT. Every girl has a sexual harassment stage in her life. Every girl has a wound from her past. Most or All girls have a crush or someone they admire even while with a boyfriend. Most love their boyfriends but don't know how to show it. And some are cheaters. 

I've always thought of girls as eggs. It's been a month since I joined this channel and the number one lesson I've got from the channel is that girls are not EGGS. I'm not judging but this is just new information.

This is a rant. an unorgonized train of thought i wish to share with you.
...
I used to say what's the point in trying. what's the point of life. but I realize now this way of thinking has gotten me nowhere. after telling myself all this, and avoiding responsibility for my life, I was still a bedfellow to angst. I still craved for things that did not profit my soul.
...
I'm not better or special but I strive to be so. I'm neither  smart nor successful, but I work towards it. I'll always be on the move 
I'll always take the hard road 
I'll always be a flowing river and never a puddle.
...
I  should always train my mind to descern poison from medicine . sometimes its hard to tell the two apart. Something that seems to benefit you is only leading you down the road of destruction
...
All my life I've been addicted to the pursuite of pleasure.
but pleasure, it turns out is  short lived. And like any drug I'm always looking forward to the next fix.
I should not be weak anymore.
...
If I ever chase for glory, I would seek to gain it in doing things that last, in things that have a concrete benefit to my fellow man.
...
We should be a generation that is willing to make sacrifices for the greater good.We should aim to be called the greatest generation. A genereation of responsibility, integrity and sacrifice.I dont care for  your choice of life style but I wish that you have the universal qualities of a great human being. I wish that history remembers us as the generation that rectified our parents mistakes.we should have a warrior ethos. a change in our collective psyche . We should all be remembered as the fearless ones
the go getters
We should reach a point in time were all of us clearly see we should bleed out of ourselves the need for the easy way out.
...
You are informed by your feelings, not ruled by them. you were given another counselor which you seem to despise: reason. This two weapons, if used wisely can be of immense benefit to you and other around you. There are those who see there feelings as the only compass of there lives, especially in matters such as love. But don't be fooled, feelings by themselves will lead you to fruitless obsessions, heart aches and bitterness.",desire,NEGATIVE,0.8746151328086853

Have you ever had to deal with a close person suffering from a chronic illness
Have you ever felt how unfair it was that good people had to go through this
Have you ever felt a chill down your spine when you find 5 missed calls from home, expecting the worst
Have you ever felt exhausted when you're not even the one in pain
Have you ever wished it all just stopped
Have you ever pretended none of it was happening, went along with your life detached from the reality of it
Have you ever been disappointed in yourself for being neglecting, for choosing to live your life merrily, as if none of it is happening
Have you ever wished you could somehow share half their pain over and over again
Have you ever felt betrayed by the gods,
blamed & screamed at them for being so cruel, begged for mercy, thanked for a day well spent
Have you ever felt a spike of anger when others give them a look of pity, as if they're dead already
Have you ever jolted in the middle of the night to check if they're still breathing soundly
Have you ever selfishly wished you would be set free from this
Have you ever felt suffocated, felt the need to scream in the middle of a conversation
Have you ever been hit by a big wave of sadness just as randomly
Have you ever automatically lied to strangers asking you how they were doing, because you're tired of having dead-end conversations
Have you ever had the urge to tell off strangers who come visit once in a while and give tips how to give optimum care, like the experts they are not
Have you ever felt so thankful for another good day devoid of sufferings

So I did something what I personally consider is a big no no. My best friend fell for this girl and she fine as fuck but obviously didn't comment further about it. She lives abroad and they met online,fell for one another,she came here and they were together for like a week or so. It's cool with me.She seemed cool. But I told him to be careful. Funny part is she stopped talking to him after a little while and he was devastated and just heart broken and shit. He took it really hard,but he eventually 'moved on'. The Internet shut down and i happen to be one of the few people online up here. So she texted me asking how I have Internet access and everything and we started talking. Our talking turned into flirting,and then sexting which was hot as fuck because that bitch was into some nasty stuff which I liked but still my best friend hadn't completely moved on so it's kinda hard continuing like this. So I tried to stop this shit but that girl is so hot I can't help bug keep going at it with her. And then she said she coming back to visit her fam for Christmas and she said she wanted to meet up. Things are gonna get nasty and hot but then there's my best friend who doesn't even know she is coming back. I feel bad though;it shouldn't be going the way it is.

So I was best friends with this girl for about 5 yrs until things got complicated because of the gossip in the school. As a result, we began to grow feelings for eachother although I think she had feelings for me earlier. One day while we were chatting it got so intense and sexy that we started sending eachother nudes and promised that we won't show it to anyone. However, like the dumb idiot I am, I sent it to a few friends to showoff. Then after a yr when I was least expecting it, I get a phone call from her. She was real mad and asked me ""How could you do such a thing? I trusted you."" In that moment I was lost for words. I could only deny that it wasn't me who leaked the nudes. I decided to tell her in person so I went to talk to her the next day. I've never seen her like this and it really broke my heart and I almost cried. She was looking stunning which made the situation a lot more difficult. Talking to her solved nothing and that day marked the end of our friendship. I tried to recover our relationship for a year and a half and I made her crack a little smile in the end but it wasn't like before. So should I give up or continue and try to make this realtionship work so that I can finally tell her that I have feelings for her?

We're still friends in a way but we make out n stuff when we're alone n we flirt n kinda sext. But infront of other ppl we dnt do anyth just act as normal friends. N my bestfriend is also friends with him n when we hang out as a group hes always complimenting her n making jokes with her...it really annoys me.

So, the dictionary defines feminist as a woman who thinks that they are equal to men, a woman who believes that legal and social restrictions on women must be removed in order to bring about equality of both sexes in all aspects of public and private life. . Why do men hate feminists? Is it because they think they are not equal, or they think they are above equal? And yes, for a woman feminism is more than what the dictionary states, its about taking care of herself by herself, its about independence, so men hate woman who are independent?

So this might be the most dangerous thing I have ever done in my entire life.
 After way to Many hours spent on the internet bored out of my skull googling and watching ""How to survive a zombie apocalypse"" tutorials on YouTube I came across this interesting piece of art. Its a Hungarian suicide song named gloomy Sunday made a couple of decades back . Supposedly it is the most dangerous song in the world 
Most of the people who have listened have some how ended up killing them selfs . 
 It puts you in depression state like no other. It literally make you pull the trigger or slit open you vein, which ever mechanism you choose to end it by. 
Becha this might be the last thing I ever write.( This is really stupid I shouldn't be Doing this). Hope am still breath by the end of the song .",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9955406785011292

I mean most of our  things get along and have so many common things,she is so beautiful and has a kind heart plus we hangout like all z time, we even drink beer together(she was both my best friend and lover).then huge problem  came up. A couple of months back her mom found out abt us and the worst part is she(her mom) saw our pic on her() phone.  Not jst anypic our naked pic together(i know its pretty careless of her) and she (idk z right word to express it) becha yemeche kewetechew. She even  made her swear to nvr talk to and see me agian.(she got into many trouble b/c of it. even grounded for a month) then zat day i received a text from her saying all z  things. I did not even know wat to say. tried to call her that week she didnt replay. Then after a couple of weeks she called saying 'i miss yu'. And we started to talk again. Then after two days she stormed out again. Shutting me up ! And she finally talked me and said 'its ma family. I cant do this anymore. If things got better at home i could get back to you then'. It was really awful. Now we havent talked for 2 months until this afternoon we bumped to each other and it was pretty weird. The thing is i was nvr over her still not b/c i didn't got a reason enough to not love her and gave up. Yea i havent tried to contact her for the last 2 months but i still have a strong feeln 4 her. Think abt her all z time. so im lost here guys need a help. Wat should i do ... try to contact her again and agian.? Or wat? (she is the dream girl) i cant jst let her go. Not jst like that.

I have been dating my bf for 3 years. We went to the states together and are staying with his dad until we find a place of our own. My bf works long hours and doesn't come home until late at night which means I spend most of my time with his dad. At first I used to stay in my room till my bf came back and didn't really spend that much time socializing with the dad. That all changed on a certain Tuesday. The dad was in the kitchen cooking and we started talking and talking and as the days went by talking changed to flirting which changed to touching until one day he was backing me up against the wall kissing me like I have never been kissed before. It wasn't until his hands were half way up my shirt that reality came back knocking. But even then I wasn't ready to stop. So what started in the kitchen went to the couch and ended in the bed. After that day it has become such an addiction that I couldn't stop doing it even if I knew how wrong it was. The real problem came about a month ago. My period was late so I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. So now I'm 3 months pregnant and I don't know who the father is...tho there's a high possibility of it being the dad's. So tell me people how am I supposed to tell my bf I'm pregnant with his brother/sister..

There is this girl. She's my bestfriend and we are very close... unlike anyother friendship I have with other girls. The other day I heard a rumor about her liking me n stuff so I wanted to know if it was true. To be honest I kinda like her and wanted us to be more than friends. So then I asked her if she cud picture me a girl that fits me or show me if she saw one and she agreed to look for her and let me know when she does. I gave her a few days and  finally, she told me that she found her and then I said ""who is she?"" and she took a while to answer bcoz she was taking long breaths to calm herself down and she replied ""my heart's beating fast."" So I gave her a brief moment and asked her again cuz I didn't know why she was acting like that. I understood when she said ""its me, I'm the one for you. I was amazed by her answer and gave her an are u serious kinda look. She was not joking and this meant that I had a gf whom I liked. Atleast that was what I was thinking. We met again a few days later and nothing seemed different. It was like the topic of ""a relationship"" didn't come up before. Both of us didn't talk about any of that and just continued with our ""friendship."" I'm really bummed out about the whole incident and please help guys. What do I do next?

So everybody is like trying to impress others, who they love, hate and don't know ! It's annoying isn't it ? I ain't gonna lie im like that too but it's not like we do it on purpose most of the time it comes automatic. We stress ourslves to create a good or ""perfect "" image for ppl that won't be zer for us. It's kinda funny how we use our head like a tv. We come home from whatever and reply everything we did and say  ""oh damn i should have said this "" or "" oh damn i should have done this"". Lemme ask you a question? what occupies your mind mostly when you're not doing anything ? Whatever your answer is... its something that matters for you for the moment !

This goes out to all the high schooler's our there. I was once like you guys I wanted to flirt, date and act as a grown up and I started doing that in my freshman year of high school. I dated 1 dude in my freshman year and 2 in my sophomore year. It was fun at the time. In my junior year of high (last year) I met this guy on telegram and we started talking a lot (and I fall for him‍obviously)... but then as every dramatic, romantic story we broke up. The shit is that we didn't just break up , I was thorn apart , I had a very rough couple of months starting from last year's summer, but after I got over it I started thinking about my self , I was only 16 when I first met him and now that I'm almost 18 I thought to myself what I'm really doing , he didn't deserve my tears. I've read so many vent comments and I saw most of high school students saying that they are in 'love' and the campus students saying that 'you're too young for that just focus on your studies'. We might see it as an offensive sentence,  but it's not. I might realized it a bit faster than you guys but I know I'm right and I also know that you're going to regret it after 1 or 2 years. So then my fellow friends if you really made it to hear then please trust me we are still kids and we have alotttttttt of things to do , we have to fulfill our dreams , study hard and make ourselves and also our parents proud.

For those who don't know me I come out as someone who don't wanna be bothered but I am always reaching out in a way. Then it happened recently that I lost a guy that meant the world to me.

You might look at a mirror and identify all your flaws right away cuz nobody knows you like you know yourself. But those flaws are not what define you they are the things that makes you want to work hard for and what makes you human. Don't ever wish to be someone other than yourself for others satisfaction. you might think you are not good enough, worthless, ugly, rude, dumb, selfish,evil,broken , boring, and etc 
And maybe you are all of those things even if most of those stuff are bad you gotta try to correct them for you not for others cuz those ppl you want to change for no matter how hurtful it might seem, will not be wid you forever but you and you will always be wid you ! So change for you and always be the best you.

   Don't wait for someone to tell you something good to lighten up your day. Do that yourself ! It's pretty easy if you're a kinda of person who gives credit to themselves cuz that way you will believe everything you tell yourself and won't wait till others do !",caring,POSITIVE,0.9902341365814209

Do you know what never seizes to amaze me? How selfish everyone has gotten. We’re always thinking of ourselves. We’re always putting ourselves first. It has become part of who we are. Our instincts selfish. I’m not saying we shouldn’t take care of ourselves. Hell no. No one takes care of you unless you do you. The kind of selfishness I’m talking about is expecting things to be done for you when you won’t do the same for others. The kind of selfishness where you’re only thinking of how hurt you are and not how badly you’re hurting others. The kind of selfishness where you’re keeping stuff just Incase but the same stuff can do wonders for someone else. The kind of selfishness where we think we’re better than others and can trick them into doing things for us. What have we come to? What’s wrong with this world?

I've been dealing with major depression my entire adult life. In high school I fought my parents to let me see a therapist, and when I finally saw one before my senior year of high school, I was diagnosed with major depression, OCD, and social anxiety disorder. Senior year was tough — I made excuses to friends as to why I was busy every Tuesday afternoon because I was embarrassed to say I was in therapy. I confided in a few close friends who were supportive, but frankly I was relieved to leave my hometown for a college in a different part of the country. I thought things would change, and that my depression would disappear because I was finally away from my hometown baggage. I was wrong.

I saw a school counselor my freshman year at college, but I was too distracted by the newness of it all to really focus on my mental health. The summer after freshman year, my depression returned in full force. Upon returning to school for the first semester of my sophomore year, I was unable to recognize that my depression had completely incapacitated me. I attempted suicide soon after the semester began — the only reason I survived is because my friends realized there was something wrong with me that night. Afterwards, I dropped out of school and returned home to get the help I so desperately needed.

I went through four different therapists and five different medications before I found the combination that worked for me, and when that happened it was not like magic, it wasn't like a beam of sunlight breaking through the clouds. It was like trudging up a mountain pass, swamped in mud and ice with an 80-pound weight around my neck. But finally I reached the peak, and started down an easier path. There are still many days that I force myself uphill again, but now my pack is a little lighter, I have the tools to make the going a little easier, and I know that I have loved ones who have and will continue to carry me on days when I just can't walk anymore. I always start hiking again the next morning. And I'm proud of myself",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.918236255645752

To y'all mofos out there that sit behind a nameless faceless bot and shame ppl with your comments, first thing first this is a channel where in we have depressed people and I don't mean the kinda depressed u say you are when your steak is over cooked or that hot girl at the counter said she don't want ur D no more. I'm talking about real depressed ppl that are on the verge of suicide. You think its cool to shame people like this? Well I'll tell you, IT'S NOT! People choose this channel for the sake on anonymity. These are mostly people that don't have anyone to talk to and hence are ranting about their secrets to strangers. These people want love and support. There are literally millions of places they could have gone to just blabber and be judged and ridiculed. I think all of you ""cool"" mofos should either gain  courage and say what u have to say without having to hide behind a bot or u can try and be a little more understanding. My hommie, a friend I met here on vent here, a very young going through hell to make a better living for his siblings and unprivileged neighborhood kids(he is barely an adult and yet finds a way to make sure they eat at least a meal a day) was ridiculed by yo mofos. (Btw I don't think cussing is cool I've just been watching too much of Bernie Mac lately) and all this guy tried was to share his views on life with you. But no, his views didn't matter to u because u were struck by the idea that he was gay, which by the way he isn't. Anyways,  I'm pretty sure life hasn't given u that much of a hard time because if life knocked u down a couple of times like it did my friend, you'd want to protect other people, you'd want to support and be the light in people's day. So why don't you please leave us, the people with real problems rant about it without having to worry about your shitty ass comments. Thank you.",disapproval,NEGATIVE,0.9985112547874451

More likely is that you yourself have some problem in your life and this is how you deal with it. If venting doesn't work, bullying won't either!

I don't know if y'all can remember me but I'm the guy who vented about how having fun in a rlshp is a good thing (plays prank with his girl)...
Any who, since she pranked me and embarrassed me in front of ppl I don't know I was not that much hurt but the revenge I came up with had made her cry.
So what happened was, during the Christmas holiday, we went to her house to visit her parents and we ate food and talked about a lot of stuff then after a while, I called her outside and asked her ""did we use any protection last night?"" And she was like ""yeah!"" then I told her ""i was kinda sober so I would remember if i put on a condom"" and then she really started doubting her thoughts bc she was drunk afff the night before and I'm sure she couldn't remember... becha she was like mumbling and stuff 
Then we got back and joined her family salon west. Then after like 10 minutes I was like ""ene helinayen kebedegn, menager alebegn benatesh forgive me, we slept together last night and I didn't use a protection"" beye kewetkut.... her face was priceless ...she was about to throw up bedenegate (how come he told my parents bela) 
Btw her parents we in on the joke...I don't want to be murdered by her dad.
Becha she wanted to kill me, I could see it on her face 
Then her parents were going along for the joke...they acted all shocked and shit.
When she started crying I told her everything...she literally punched me in the stomach very hard and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day...But now we r cool

I've tried to get out the hole for a while now. I even stopped cutting. Its been almost a year since I stopped cutting. I mean I should be proud, ecstatic. But I'm miserable. There's just something about that blood man. That crimson liquid running down your arms that just seems to lift the heavy load suffocating you. Every swipe of the blade washes away a little bit of the grief you carry with you . Friends and family see your arms covered with crooked scars that run deep and ask you where you got those. You answer , almost automatically , the story you've rehearsed inside your crowded head so many times that you almost start to believe it yourself.

'' If I knew the point of pain is what i realized today, I would wish for much more pain for every birthday candle I blow""

Hello beautiful souls
This is a massage from person who has been lost in pain and sorrow for a while, a person who lost everything and stood alone in this awful world. a person who has a heart full of scars and aches, a person who was abandoned and betrayed with everyone she has trusted. My life was horrible all along but the past 4 months I went through much more pain. A lot of things happened and people that I count on start to abandoned me one by one. at some point I left all alone, let alone my problems i didn't even had anyone to share my sadness to. My loneliness got to the level where I talked to total strangers in taxi about my sadness, they probably thought am depressed or something. considering how i used to be that wasn't my proudest moment at all. over all I had to deal with my problems, sorrow and everything on my own. Then all of a sudden I started to notice something different on me, the pains started to create a girl who is much more strong, who isn't scared to do anything, a girl who craves for her alone time, a girl who is in love with herself and a girl who I tried to build but failed for the past 25 years that very moment it hit me pain is what nurtured us to grow, 

Unless we got lost in the forest which was designed to make us strong looking for directions from confused people who are looking for their ways too, we will find ourselves in the same forest we lost in eventually.  Stay strong",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.891077995300293

Yes I need to vent. It's a long one bear with me. Okay so here it goes. Our parents knew each other long before we were born. And it's hard for me to say that we grew up together because we didn't meet that frequently but I have known him all my life. I don't know him as much as I want to though. Not yet at least. We're in college now. He's at AAU I'm abroad. We used to hang out occasionally till 7th grade keza bemehal idk what happened gin he disappeared. Whenever his family was invited to our house he wouldn't show up.. not even to gatherings outside. So I confronted him in 10th grade after not seeing him for a while. Having known each other since childhood, I told him that we should have been more close. And he never missed an invitation after that. I spent the night before I left for college at his house but we didn't do anything. Only I wish we had . We met up a couple of times when I came back for the summer. We walked holding hands and touching  ( my heart was smiling the whole time) Over the summer I have noticed things.. like we met up on our own, Lela gize our parents bet simetu menamen neber menegenagnew, and he was more chatting than ever before. He's usually quite neger.. And this one night we were eating dinner out and he said he liked me and he trusted me and wants to keep me close. And I am holding on to that. I didn't say anything about me liking him ( so damn much )... Only mentioned it vaguely over a text once classes started. I regret not looking into his eyes or other signs when we were together. Whenever I was with him I was just so happy I didn't  think of anythinglike my mind was Blank except for that specific moment with our hands wrapped against each others isn't that crazy. Telling him I've loved him ever since is not going to happen because I can't lose him. What if he gets scared off? ‍So I'm just going to wait and see... give it all the time it needs and see if we will be together But I also fear that I might be waiting for too long and things could fall apart.

And that's not even the problem...I have trust issues..like u have to be with me for at least a year until I trust u and even then I still have my doubt's.

  And also my love life is a complete bleh .like I have non and I know there are some people who say ""you're in highschool eko what love life?"" And to those people I would like to say that this vent doesn't concern you. For everyone else who gets me I Dont,can't get or have a boyfriend.

Okey, let's start by saying I'm depressed. I have depression. My depression isn't new. I thought it was dibirt or because things were not good for me. But after i get what i want(not all) I'm still depressed. My depression isn't a problem to me when I'm alone. Rather it disturbs me a lot when I'm with peers. After associating for 5 minutes max i finish my 'battery'. I just want to walk away. And people notice that. And i don't know how to tell them I'm depressed. Because telling to ethiopians that you are depressed means you are telling them that, THEY are depressing people. They will say 'Debari neh eyalkegn new'  minamn...

I was with some of my friends, and a conversation sparked up of the sexual nature. They asked me what my first time was like , I told them i have never been in that scenario before. They acted surprised (and somewhat offended, for some reason)  and asked . Whats your pussy made of? Gold? YES BITCH ITS MADE OF FUCKING GOLD. IF THAT'S HOW I WANT IT!!! I honestly don't get why people feel the need to label every thing. Like if i don't like people getting private with me I'm prude ?and if i like going out and hooking up with randos I'm a slut?

YES PEOPLE LIKE TO FUCK . GET OVER IT!  
And why do people feel the need to give their opinions to every damn thing. Like i see your point of view but i politely decline and choose to do my own shit thank you very much .

Ok so the last year one of my best friends was like super down all the time. At night she would call or text and we would talk about her problems. She would tell me she wanted to die and i would tell her she was too important to just leave. It worked for a while, but then she started coming up eith reasons why she should just kill herself. I didnt know what to, i would try talking her out of it but no luck. I couldnt sleep cause i was always so freakin worried all the damn time. Time passed and she would text me the word goodbye and i would freak out and call her a bunch of times and start thiniking of ways to get to her house (i suck at directions, dont know how to use taxis, and i cant afford a car anyways). But then soon i would find out she was ok.
This kept happening for a while. She would be ok, then out of nowhere hint at her plans suicide. I would freak out. Make some sort if decision like talking to her parents or something. Then she would be ok.
I should have done better. I should have done more... but i had no idea how to deal with this. This was the first time i have ever encountered someone with thoughts like this. I was scared shitless. I thought i was gonna lose her.
At some point i started considering ending it myself. I couldnt take anymore. 
But then she started to get better... all by herself. She was still insecure, but she started to look for a purpose. I reason to live.
I could breathe a little easier 
Then suddenly my other friend got depressed as well. She would self harm and stuff.
What. The. Hell.
She would hint at suicide. Then be ok again. No matter what i say or do, it wouldnt affect her at all.
At this point i felt like the universe was just toying with me. I would cry myself to sleep. I was useless. I had no idea how to help the ones i care about.
Suddenly I stopped.
At night they would be like 'im a mess my life's a mess im done'. Before i would try and convince them they're not. They matter. And i wasnt just saying it. They do. But now  i would be like 'ayzosh' the fall asleep. I would have a headache, but then fall asleep the moment my head touches the pillow.
I would forget about them and their stuff. They eould text me and tell me they made it they feel better now and i would be like ""wha...?"" Then remember.
So for those of you who actually read the whole thing... idk if i stopped caring. Like, i love them and all, but i dont think of they're problems much anymore. I dont cry because im afraid i would lose them anymore. Im just...there. i feel nothing.

But we all learn from our mistakes and bad judgement. Now I know that nothing is always as perfect as it seems on the outside. Actually nothing was perfect with us. It was me who was blind since the beginning. And as much as I regret giving you all these chances you never deserved, I'm glad it didn't take me longer to wake up.

I wish I knew why you did all that you did. But I guess you don't even have a reason, and it wouldn't matter anyway. I'm not cruel like you so I won't wish you anything bad. I just hope you will be able to deal with all the mess you're in and figure out yourself so that you won't drag some other girl into your game like you did with me.",anger,POSITIVE,0.9834660887718201

Hello all
I just wanna let this out
This is not about how depressed i am, i dont think i am, i was... Kinda. This is for deppressed people.. 
Let me try to make this as short as possible. 
When I was younger my very close relative tried to end his/her life. I was beyond shocked,I did a lot to try to make them happy. It broke my heart hearing them say that they were alone, that no one loved or cared  for them. I was here, i did... Soon i started to feel the same way. I couldn't stand seeing them like that but trust me its a lot better than seeing them lifeless, I dont think I can ever live with that. I just want to say someone out there really cares for you, they really love you maybe not the way you want it, but with all they've got. So stop telling yourself you are lonely and not loved because you all are loved , im sure of it. Just be grateful for the things you have, you may not know it but its a lot... Sorry if this is too long i just felt like it needed to be said.

How could I have been so completely wrong abt the ppl around me? The ppl I trusted most turned around to stab me in the back. And now too much time has passed, everyone expects me to move on. Why the fuck can’t I? It’s like I’m stuck in this same hurt place because there’s so much I didn’t get to say and will never get to say to the sick bastards that played me for a fool. Oh but if I cud... 

I’d say that just because I loved u with everything I had doesn’t mean I’m weak and naive. I chose to love and trust u because it made me happy and all I wanted was that same love in return. I would have forgiven ANYTHING u could possibly do to me because u were a part of my life I never saw myself letting go. But u won’t let me forgive u because u choose to lie to me and whisper things behind my back. But I can hear all ur whispered words and sometimes I wish I was deaf to them. I want to move on but how can I when every time u come around I want to slam my fist against ur face for hurting me but I can’t. 

I’m tired of venting to my friends cause they’ll get tired of hearing it. I got hurt. Big deal. It’s time to move on. I used to be a big tough girl who cud swallow whatever twisted shit came her way but now I feel like u rly knocked me out with this one. I had my guard down and u knew it. U took advantage. Fuck u and all the words you’ll never hear me say. Now that I see clear as day the fucking lying cheating piece of shit I called my own, I’d love to say I’ll never be blinded by ppl like u again. But I can’t help falling into the same fucking cycle over n over, constantly trusting the wrong ppl, constantly putting others above me only to have them use me and disappear when I need them most. 

And I honestly don’t understand why u think ur all that. Ur dick is the size of my pinky finger u fucking prick. And so help me God if u threaten me one more time I will rain hell on ur tiny manhood with a hammer.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9964007139205933

Lately I think I have lost hope in z relationship am in. Me and my guy we have been together for 3 and a half years and its a long distance r/n ship. And when we get time to meet up we usually do. Due to work and stuff I use to be so busy and he put up with all that but now when am free he seems to be busy and I am not feeling wanted and loved any more. When he calls he asks how am doing, how my day is and zen he says he gotta go! Sometimes I wont have even z chance 2 ask how his day was. When we meet up he just make up jocks and I feel like it was okay but when am back home and when I analyzed it back I feel like we were just there cause we must meet not cause we want to and z whole jock thing feels like it fills z gap that is there and that is over growing! Z jock annoys me now! I can't stand 2 hear it and I don't feel like hearing his voice or reading his texts. Sometimes I just let my phone ring so that I don't have 2 talk 2 him and listen 2 z stupid jocks. But zen I regret it instantly and feel like a dirty bad person. I call him right away saying I was doing some work or didn't c it. I wanna talk stuff that r real, sth that isn't a jock or sth that isn't funny. Don't get me wrong I love this man, I adore him but these past few weeks have been hard on me! I don't wanna tell him how am feeling cause I feel like I will scare him away and seem like an attention seeker and a clingy person.  Am I selfish for feeling this way?

Hello Everyone
Girls would you help out a brother here pls. I need a genuine answere for what I'm about to ask you. So i met this girl two days ago, as per a request from her brother that i hand her something that he needed. FYI, i and her brother used to be roommates and are best friends. He is currently somewhere else. So i was really  freaked out about our meeting thinking how i would screw my first impression. But contrary to my fear , our meeting went very well and we talked a lot. I found everything about her so freaking lovely‍. It felt like we had a connection and that I finally met my type. We parted soon after the business and now am crazyly obsessed with her. Oh boy.... i have that funny feeling around my chest now for the first time in a long while. Having said that now, the question goes like, what are the chances that she feels the same way or that she thinks about the possibility of us being more than friends? Fingers crossed she and her brother are not memebers of this channel for the details are so specific",admiration,POSITIVE,0.9955001473426819

So here it goes,I decided to give this man a shot and we had a very good time together,its an understatement to say 'he blew me away',never been the one to be impressed easily but he had me then,some day we started kissing and things got heated up and he wanted more than just kissing but I kept saying no again and again until he finally agreed to stop,well at least that's what I thought until he pushed himself in,he didn't continue because i was freaking out but he did take my virginity .I still don't know what to make of it because I told him I was a virgin and that I didn't want to have sex from the very start and i said no as clearly as possible at the time but I also went to his house alone and made out with him.At the time I was just shocked thinking it was an accident but looking back I'm coming to the realization that he might have done it on purpose .So i don't know what to call it was it rape or am I just being immature?",confusion,NEGATIVE,0.9591652750968933

I don't even know what I am feeling anymore. Have you ever felt like you have lost sth you never even had in the first place? Have you ever wanted someone sooooo bad that you think of them everytime? Every memory, every cute text that used to make ur heart skip a beat is now a bullet piercing through the same heart? Our relationship never had a label but he used to tell me he liked me a lot and he used to say these adorable lines...He prolly didn't care about me when all those times he said he did. He prolly felt nothing when he shut me out and forget my existance as a whole. I told myself to get over him since I was nothing to him, he shouldn't have a place in my heart right? No. Like the fool I am I have already firgiven him before he even asked for forgiveness...its like I would reply in a second if he texts a simple hello...I liked him, I still do... God!

Well I'll need all the attention of the girls in this channel.. 

I have a friend that has been sexually traumatized since the tender age of 15, by an abuse made by a very close relative. Which has later led to major complications in her life.. I know most girls here in Ethiopia have went through this pain.

I'm only a 17 years old girl. I something wonder if there's someone out there worrying too much about everything like me. every time I'm worrying that I sometimes forget what I had plan to do. I didn't study for the exam_I worry. I did study for the exam_I worry. People laughed at me_I worry. Ppl I talk to doesn't anymore on social media or real life_I worry........ The point is I worry and nothing ever stops me from it except talking to any of my friends and hang out with them. I'm a huge worrier. And I just want your help...

OK people I Dont know if this can help but depression ,emptyness ,weight gain or loss ,behavioral changes .....can sometimes be explained by other medical conditions like hypothyroidism,hyperthyroidism......you can put any of the things that have become different on your body including your mood changes into symptoms and search for them on the internet or any other place. Medical explanation for mood changes are extremely common and treatable .when you find out something else might have caused you to suffer mentally you can stop blaming yourself.and even if depression and other mood changes occur without underlying medical conditions its still very important to get yourself some sort of help .because these things have a way of manifesting into bigger problems if left untreated.",caring,NEGATIVE,0.9297175407409668

How do u deal with someone being so very important to you, that u think about them every single second of every single day? How do u deal with the fact that they might never see you the same? They care about you, they love you and u make them happy, and yet they're living in memories of the past that they cant see that they have someone who would give up anything, do anything just to see a smile on that beautiful face you adore so much. How do u deal with the horrid truth that maybe just maybe u should forget  about the person but every fiber of you wants them so much that they show up in your day dreams as well as night ones. Tell how i feel? Then what? Get rejected and lose the most amazing person you know, who i happen to see constantly. Ahh how i love you.",love,POSITIVE,0.99289470911026

At the moment, there is nothing I crave more than to travel. And the desire to see the different parts of our planet actually causes me a physical pain in my chest It doesn’t even has to be the world, just crossing a few borders around and seek for adventures would be enough.

But most of all, more than anything, I want be by the sea, breathing in the heavy scent of salty water and wet sand, reading crime novels and writing poetry, the infinity of the ocean reminding me that I am, in fact, free.

Bear with me if u might, just venting. This past year has changed a lot in me. From meeting a twin flame to losing a person I called a best friend. I am such a weakling. I can't say no. Even to things I clearly should have said no to. I've changed. I'm not sure I like this new me. I'm being a people's person(and enjoying it) until I come home alone and in the death of the night I realize I like none of the ppl I spend my days with. I'm sooo full of hate yet soo full of love. I don't even know if that makes sense. I love helping out ppl, doing this doing that for them but when I'm alone I realize that they're just, nothing. He was everything. He was my twin flame. He raised my standards and for eyes that has seen him everything else is just non sense. I just want to be back to where I was. Or better, I wanna die. Not like suicide, but I want to get sick. Really sick (I know, I know that's not as easy as it sounds) but then, I don't want my family to waste money on me. In fact I am sick. It's just not fatal. And I haven't told anyone. I'm soo scared of everything. I'm scared of ppl, I'm scared of being alone, I'm scared of telling ppl how I feel. But even if I face that fear no one would understand, trust me I've tried. I just want to leave. I hate how I'm so weak, so unfit for ""humanhood"". I think I'm really going nuts. You know right now I just want to be an assassin or smtn.

My parents are what u call very conservative n religious ppl n I am my parents daughter I have never been reckless or did  something that upset my parents till 3 months ago.

Three months ago I met this guy n i knew nothing will happen between us coz he has quit a reputation in the neighborhood n I have seen first hand the gals going in leaving his house but we got in to talking when we bump into each other every time we leave the house n I found out how interesting he was n start hanging out as friends but my parents found out n they freaked!

 Before the this whole thing I can call my mom n tell her I'm sleeping over at a friend house for this reason no follow up questions she would say okey but now every time i leave the house I get integrated where I'm going w whom when I'm coming back n they would call me 3 or more times a day n if I don't answer they would call my friends.
It was getting crazy so I sat down w my mom n told her we were just friends but she didn't buy it n she said "" even for some miracle we are friends ppl won't see it that way they will think I'm just another gal he is using n that will destroy my image n the family"".
 I could see how worried n disappointed she was plus she got some good points so I figured he ain worth of putting my parents trough  hell so I drafted away from him. Now I didn't expect to gain my parent trust right away but I tot it will happen eventually but it's been couple of month but it didn't. Constantly doubting me n making my sister the good daughter has been a thing and my sister who is suppose to have my back choose to get high on my parents attention so I haven't talked to her for almost a month which is a pretty big deal since she was my best friend I would imagine her face when I tell he while something is happening to me my day won't be complete if I didn't told her n hear about her day but now I'm afraid we won't get that relation back coz every time my parents praise her or affectionate towards her I hate her a Lil more every time.

Last month, my girlfriend told me she was raped after strictly warning me to not ask any question.

Today, I found out that she went to the supposed raper's HOTEL ROOM  herself. She went there expecting to make out with him but he further engaged himself in forceful penetrative sex.

Now, I'm not even sure what to feel. Should I be sad about what she did to me (this is the third time)? Or agitated about what he did to her?",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9936760067939758

So this is gonna be pretty messed up 
Im a highschool girl n an introvert. I get really awkward with ppl that i always have the worst first impression n i get misunderstood a lot. I basically dont know how to communicate. But once u get to know me im like the crazies n most obsessive n fun girl. But still i have this problem idk how to talk i get so insecure abt how i should be acting around ppl like sometimes i practice what to say n doin certain situations. I think that's bc i had a fucked up childhood, didn't have a lot of friends n ppl pushed me away n stuff, some point i tried to commit suicide but that's not the point. Well i reallyyyyy wanna learn how to be not scared of ppl, that's part one
The other thing is i have insecurities. A lot of them. As i said i tried to commit suicide once before and i was heavily depressed n now i think im relatively better but the depression is still there. I write abt my dark thoughts n feelings all the time idk y everytime i grab a pen and start to write nothing positive comes out it's all negative n dark. Nobody reads them n i dont think anyone knows how fucked up i feel. Ik all the ""u should just be urself n not care what ppl say"" shit n i tried it but it's easier said than done for someone who wants the love and attention she missed when she was a child. Sometimes I hate my face, my body, my persinalitu, the way i think, n evrything else at times i feel so pathetic that i just wanna curl to a ball and stay in a corner forever. 
Lastly i learn in an all girls school I've been learning there for yrs i have NO guy friends irl like none. Idk how to get along with them or start a convo but i would rly love to have guy friends n i have parents who don evn want me to breathe the same air as boys bc they blv it's a bad influence n stuff n idk how imma be when i go to university its a new place wid new ppl, strangers everywhere...... so the idea alone pretty much makes me panic

What are the traits of a psychopath? Because I'm beginning to think that I am one. I've been reading a lot about the psychopathology of this disease and I have almost all of the traits. It started when I was 12 when I got the sudden urge to make my puppy bleed. I don't know how to explain it but I just wanted to see its blood...at first. I took a knife to its stomach and made one smooth slit. The sight of the blood and the sound  of agony the dog made gave me a rush that I am now addicted to. I ended up cutting that dog up into pieces that day. That was the day I was reborn. My urges escalated from then on. By the age 16 I had killed 8 dogs, 4 cats and burned down my brother's room. I am 24 years old now and I am now certain I'm diseased. The sight of someone bleeding gets me so excited...the satisfaction is unbelievable. I am beginning to need it more and more. I'm addicted. I want to cause pain in people. I want to make someone bleed and watch the life leave their eyes.

I was brought to this earth without my consent.
I was raised to believe in a certain God i wouldn't have worshipped  had I been born in another family. From my early childhood i was thought that i had an all powerful, all loving, all knowing God but i was expected not to ask to hear his voice or expect to see the mind boggling  miracles that I've read in the holy book. Because those who hear and believe are righteous. And worshipping God was not enough the way i worshipped him was also important so i was confused as to whether i should worship him  in a orthodox church or in a pentecostal church . The believers around me were so sure of their God that it made me jealous. An orthodox would come and tell me the many miracles he saw( or heard of) in his church, a protestant friend of mine would come and tell me about the prophecies  that his pastor has imparted on his congregation and a muslim friend of mine would tell me the profound effect the holy Qur'an has had on his life. I wander what I'll hear about Buddhism( or any other belief system) if i had a Buddhist for a friend.
And the troubling thing is that all of them say I'll go to hell unless I submit to thier respective religion.
The amazing thing is that all of them have complex explanations as to why their religion is right. For every question i bring their priests, pastors and teachers of the Qur'an would surely find an answer. And even they didn't find an answer there was one statement they all shared: just have faith.

For all my fellow introverts

+ Got out more, meet new people  even if you would say as much as you'd like to.
+ Join organisations like toast masters, rotract and many other  clubs
+ Go to events and share any kind of work you've got. It a great ice breaker
+ When ever you have a fear of interacting with people do it any way. At first you might mumble and fumble but you'll adjust and people are way more forgiving than you'd think
+ When ever you want to interact with a person instead of trying to make yourself interesting, try to find something interesting in them
+ Know that being an introvert is not a bad thing. Many great minds were introverts. And unlike extroverts who have many ""friends""(more like acquaintances) but very few close friends, introverts form very strong bonds of friendship",approval,POSITIVE,0.984669029712677

If your brain can't stop thinking about the ladies but cant seem to act try this
$ Phase1: try without trying
For next few weeks your aim should not be to get girls but to build yourself confidence. And to do that you can do anything that tells you that you are a man of action or anything other than the thought of girls that gives you a sense of purpose. Eg.
# Play sports and socialise with other guys: you'll learn a lot about social interaction from other guys. Plus exercise is a great way to boost your confidence
# do things that put you in a socialising environment. The parties you talked about are a good start. While there don't just try to talk to girls talk to everyone. It doesn't matter what you talk about just talk. Its a great way to relieve the anxiety that comes with talking to girls later on
$ Phase2: desensitize yourself from rejection. I think most of our fear of talking to girls comes from the fear of rejection so for a week or so your goal should be only to get rejected. Make it a game, if you go out and a girl accepts your advances it means you lost. The more ok with rejection you are the more you'll be able to take risks with the ladies.
$ Phase3: there is no one way to flirting with girls. Dont try to stick to the lines your cool friend uses.  So just freestyle with it. And since you have come to accept rejection as an expected part of the game you'll be more open with your intentions
$ Phase4: practice
Every girl is diffrent. One might be smart, one's got a great booty, the other has a great sense of humour... etc so go out there and try to find out about each one of their qualities
$ Phase5: after your first few rejections you might take the lame route of generalizing girls. DON'T. even brad pitt is hated by some you're no exception. Lick your wounds and get back up in the game.",caring,NEGATIVE,0.5012690424919128

Yes, better to jerk yourself off than fuck with a rubber on, but protection is a must when you have an open sex life.

Might be a long post so bear with me. Imma keep this anonymous, despite being certain pretty much anyone who knows me would pin the post to myself. Imma conceal my identity either way to distant myself from you creeps and stalkers tho. I have noticed a certain trend as of late. A rise in the number of non believers and agnostics seems to have peaked in the past few years in mama Ethiopia. If you asked  fellow religious teachers of any faith, they almost certainly accredit it to the ""devilish"" nature of the West, and how it bestowed on us a form of thinking that is not our own. In this day and age, coming out as a non believer or even a skeptic to your close  ones might seem like the most difficult task imaginable, especially if your upbringing involves your being FORCED to be taken to your place of worship every fucking Sunday morning despite your best attempts otherwise. Which is sth everyone, including myself can relate to. But as you grow older and older, ridding yourself of all the stuff that's been fed to your once naive mind, you start to realize that maybe, just maybe, that life of faith and religion isn't for you. Maybe, just maybe, there is no heaven or hell. And even if u happen to be mistaken you don't care enough to lead your life in such a way that would end you in your desired destination, but rather lead it with regards to your own principles and morals, but not in hopes that doing things X Y Z would help you inherit the kingdom of heaven or what not. You just try to live your life to the fullest, knowing there is no higher being judging your every step as if he has nothing better to do. Like forgive me here, but if you had all the powers that God is presumed to have, would you really bore yourself with all the petty shit humans do everyday? Or would you perhaps create more universes and have by colliding the stars and all that shit. I digress. Coming back to topic, the problem with our society is that we like to shame anyone who does not blend in with the crowd. We have this sheep mentality where you're either with us or against us. We are not open to having controversial conversations regarding anything, and if we have that one outside the box thinker friend who brings up these topics, we are so scared of bursting our bubbling and expanding our comfort zones that we immediately shame him/her for thinking differently and almost immediately force him/her to STFU by saying ""jemerew demo , ante eko sijemer begziar atamnem, beka tewen temechetonal egna"". Becha I'm sorry if this offends some people as I'm sure it might. All comments are welcome and will love to laugh my ass off with your mean ass comments that will surely tell me I'm destined for eternal fire and stoning or what not.

SOCIAL MEDIA 

For all the good social media offers its dark side is far more frightening . You notice it when a person is very chill and relaxed online but goes all numb in real life. It tends to take away from real life what it has given in cyberspace. 
Most social media addicts this days are plain awkward when it comes to social interactions. You can see it in their body language. Most are scared shitless when you approach them to strike up a conversation .
Plus the sense of community it gives you while you are online is rarely transferable to the realm of things you can touch, smell and see.
It has taken away the painful but much needed practice of expressing ones own feelings- face to face - at the risk of looking like a totall fool. Online, you could edit, delete or act all cocky 'cuz you dont run the risk of showing your face as it awkwardly  cringes or for that matter the look of disapproval on the face of the person on the other side of the screen.",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9958755373954773

""You'll love this... its an excerpt from paulo coelho's book ""the zahir""
Some will get offended ofcourse so if u don't have a thick skin DON'T read it...
Years ago, I read a book that told an interesting story. Just suppose that Hitler had won the war, wiped out all the Jews and convinced his people that there really was such a thing as a master race. The history books start to be changed, and, a hundred years later, his successors manage to wipe out all the Indians. Three hundred years later and the Blacks have been eliminated too. It takes five hundred years, but, finally, the all-powerful war machine succeeds in erasing all Asians from the face of the earth as well. The history books speak of remote battles waged against barbarians, but no one reads too closely, because it’s of no importance.
“Two thousand years after the birth of Nazism, in a bar in Tokyo, a city that has been inhabited for five centuries now by tall, blue-eyed people, Hans and Fritz are enjoying a beer. At one point, Hans looks at Fritz and asks: ‘Fritz, do you think it was always like this?’
“‘What?’ asks Fritz.
“‘The world.’
“‘Of course the world was always like this, isn’t that what we were taught?’
“‘Of course, I don’t know what made me ask such a stupid question,’ says Hans. They finish their beer, talk about other things and forget the question entirely.”
“You don’t even need to go that far into the future, you just have to go back two thousand years. Can you see yourself worshipping a guillotine, a scaffold, or an electric chair?”
“I know where you’re heading—to that worst of all human tortures, the cross. I remember that Cicero referred to it as ‘an abominable punishment’ that inflicted terrible suffering on the crucified person before he or she died. And yet, nowadays people wear it around their neck, hang it on their bedroom wall, and have come to identify it as a religious symbol, forgetting that they are looking at an instrument of torture.”
“Two hundred and fifty years passed before someone decided that it was time to abolish the pagan festivals surrounding the winter solstice, the time when the sun is farthest from the earth. The apostles, and those who came after them, were too busy spreading Jesus’ message to worry about the natalis invict Solis, the Mithraic festival of the birth of the sun, which occurred on December 25. Then a bishop decided that these solstice festivals were a threat to the faith and that was that! Now we have masses, Nativity scenes, presents, sermons, plastic babies in wooden mangers, and the cast-iron conviction that Christ was born on that very day!”
“And then there’s the Christmas tree. Do you know where that comes from?”
“No idea""
Saint Boniface decided to ‘christianize’ a ritual intended to honor the god Odin when he was a child. Once a year, the Germanic tribes would place presents around an oak tree for the children to find. They thought this would bring joy to the pagan deity.”
“Going back to the story of Hans and Fritz: do you think that civilization, human relations, our hopes, our conquests, are all just the product of some other garbled story?”

First vent. Heard it helps.
So 2 years back I got into the wrong crowd at the wrong age cuz of the unhappiness I felt at home. Started drugs at the age of 14 a lil bit of drinking too don't get me wrong I loved my friends but they never gave a shit except themselves so a guy that I called my bestfriend tried to fuck me in a bar cause he was 'bored' I was drunk but thank god ppl got him off of me before he had a chance worst part is I remember everything, every word, every touch, every look yet I never saw there faces after that day I can't seem to forget them and I slowly started dying can't seem to trust anyone and don't want to be trusted either but after some time I knew what I had to do and got my self up. I moved on. And now I don't know y but the nightmares r back. I just want to disappear but yet am too weak to take my own life and that just makes things a whole lot worse.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9979643821716309

I have already gave up on my future and all my dreams. But what scares me the most is suicide. It pops onto my mind a lot more often than like 2 years ago.

I just wanted your opinions on this
So my really good guy freind asked my sister out. 
As a freind i should be happy for him and, I would if this wasn't my sister who is 12, he is 17... 
My freinds told me that I should be happy for him. Believe me, if they were age-compatible I would be. The age thing bothers me a lot
Demo i knew this guys for 4 years you'd think he'd tell me and I don't really trust or see him as I use to before all this, he changed

I'm not hungry nor sleepy im just weak. I was just scared that i assumed i was going to spend the rest of my days endezi. But then i had an epiphany literally. Darkness really does follow me and i have accepted it but what if i fight back bring the old me back. In my bed days i believed i was not loved nor cared for and i finally found out who truly wants me to be happy and others who wish to see me lost. My point is ik being depressed ik having suicidal thoughts. I know that it all seems like a tunnel and no light at the end but what if just WHAT IF you were the light and you never got to see it cause its with in you and you yourself is the one creating the tunnel.

This is not a vent, don't need your perspectives as much either.
FACTS 
1- I have these problem where I can't be faithful (as I used to call it ""owner of a heart big enough for all of them"")
2- I am trying to stop.
3- so as to stop I wanted to dedicate my self to a chick who wasn't like the others who was a good girl and a girl I genuinely liked.
3- I stopped texting and calling all the  girls in my life.
4- but after I did that, the girl decided I wasn't enough for her high moral standards and left.
PROBLEM 
1- I know am going back to my old ways cause no matter what strangers comment about how disgusting it's is to play with others feelings and how low I am to be like this. It honestly doesn't faze me one bit cause, what about me? What about my feelings? I can't gamble with my feelings so as to conform to the societies values. I should look out for #1 and look out for my own feelings. Bitch! I am putting my eggs in so many different baskets!
STATEMENT 
1- I see qualities in a bad girl. (Realistic, down to earth, open, fun)
2- Good girls are bad news. (Dull, guarded, condescending, dreamy)

I amn’t writing about my problem rather i am here to complain about some stupid ,arrogant peoples in this channel. I'm wondering if there's a word or term for a person who looks for an opportunity to insult and berate other people.

I'm sure you've all been there; There's always that one person who gets completely offended, or they take things completely out of context. They then proceed to publicly scold and shame you - excessively, it seems. It makes you wonder if maybe they're just looking for something to complain about, or if they enjoy being abusive? Maybe they just get a kick out of making you look bad, and want everyone else to take there side!!

""Troll"" and ""butthurt"" seem to fit fairly well ‍
So in this channel i heard that we can vent about anything without  not being judged lately i was reading the comments nd people be like your grammer is worse than your current situation,mind your grammer  bla bla 
Ok fine well your grammer is good so what go and write a book ‍stop judging people if u dnt have anything good to say it’s not must to write a comment you can shutup nd keep your comment for yourself stop hurting people with your stupid comments!!!!

In my opinion the greatest achievement one can reach when it comes to love, is to be balanced. To use both our heads and our hearts.
For some reason, most of us have a stupid tendency to take our positions to the extremes.
Some go all in throwing caution to the wind and proudly claim that they did something 'just cuz they felt like it.'
Others, thinking themselves the spocks( that weird expressionless dude from star trek) othe world, walk around boasting that they have no place for emotions. They claim that love is either usless or non-existent.

OK I don't get it,I keep on hearing and reading comments ""this is Ethiopia you live in!"" for things like ,""I'm an atheist "",""masturbation"",""personality disorder"",""depression"",""sex"".................basically anything that has to do with being open and honest about things that are not accepted.I don't understand how living in Ethiopia makes you exceptionally different from the rest of humanity!,or maybe its that weird belief that Ethiopia is a chosen, blessed country!
i mean seriously are we supposed to stand still while the rest of the world moves on to better civilizations because this blessed country(which is still a 3 world country)can not keep up with change!!I have met up with people from other African countries and they always complain that Ethiopians have this superiority complex when it comes to being African,like you know how we say when we refer to other African nationalities ""ya africawiw sewye/setiyo"",like we are not African ourselves.kurat and tibar gets us nowhere so instead of bragging again and again and again and again......about the accomplishments that our ancestors were responsible for and we certainly had nothing to do with, we should focus on now and do something ourselves . We are not better or less than anyone.Dont get me wrong be proud of who you are but when you warm your ass sitting around for your whole life instead of making some change in society, remember that you are just a bum .And even if you are doing something  complaining how ""not Ethiopian like"" people around you are  definitely makes you a an ignorant asshole because people are different and these people make up Ethiopia.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9969292283058167

We all would like to think moral values are what keep our societal order intact. .......NOT.
Everytime you cross the road its not the strangers morality you put your trust in, its his self interest. Believing he wont run into you because he has something to lose. No matter how civilized mankind might seem, the fuel of our progress is still something very premitive - a never ending search for easier lives. Everyone, no matter how selfless they might seem, are always nurturing their self interest. Humanity, beyond its great illusory veils of greatness is a mere quivering child. This simple truth is what keeps me alive, devoid of hope, alove nontheless. Hope, love, morality are all illusions, imaginary concepts we decided to agree on jus like money.

I always wonder about this pain, the pain the girls always complain about, but the boys have never experienced it. They made it sound as if we boys have no feelings and we r just robots made to hurt them.

Just looking for an anonymous audience.
  So a friend told me sexuality is not a characteristic of growing up. To which i replied that sertain sexual acts are nessassary to be called a 'Grown Up'. Now this stikes me as odd, because i never realized i thought like this, i never noticed that i measured maturity through sexuality. And i was shocked! But after a while i realized, its not actually sexuality i measure it by but our neglection of things that were frowned upon when we were kids -one of which is sex- but now are a daily part of life. For example 5 years ago i thought of cursing as something i would never do, but now i think of it as theraputic, i regarded sex a sacred and holly thing but now i see it as a sort of distraction from boredom(not that there's anything is worng with that).

I don't know why people tend to take out their bad moods on me.I tend to be very open minded about everything. I try as much as I can to not judge anyone and respect them because I don't hate anyone. And then after some time they just snap at me. Like what have I ever done to them. I ask them if they're alright and they just tend to ignore me because I even asked that question.

Sometimes there are those times were am like ‘how the hell am I supposed to get through this?’ I cage myself in and don’t let anyone in because I don’t know how they will see me after they learn my past.



The last couple of years I’ve caged myself into a small group of friends and don’t really talk to anyone but I swear mess with me and you won’t hear the end of it.




I have a dark side only a couple have seen, I don’t mean for it to be shown how it does but sometimes it happens.


We all have that one side that we don’t want to be seen. It could be by our friend’s family or loved ones. For me, my dark side is my weakness. Its rom my past everything known to tell will make people look at me in a new perspective. I don’t want to be seen as a monster or as a person that is trying to hide herself from the world.




See the thing is, that’s who I am. That’s what I do, I cage myself only to me and don’t let the key be found. Anyone who find that opening will see something that will brand their mind forever, from a different perspective including me, my life and history with everything between.



I have a past life I would not curse upon anyone except for the ones who lived through it, everything I have been through has made me stronger and have more power to work through things that I would have never been able to go through before.


Through, there are still those moments I sit by myself because I don’t understand myself are things I did. Most of the time its to protect myself. I don’t want to be known as the one that did it because she could or wanted to. I want to be known as I did it because I had to. 



People say things and that’s why I am who I am today.


They think the carefree attitude I possess as ignorance.
As stupidity.


People mistake the dumb moments I have as “uncharacteristic.” But then never let me live down those times where I made an error due to something not being thought through enough.



People push around, thinking that they’re the boss because they have something I don’t.


Or the opposite; they trick me into thinking that they’re honest companions, willing to offer me their potential so that we may improve together. 


People mistake my threats, hollow or not, to be jokes.

‘Yeah, as if.’
‘No way would’ you
‘You’re just trying to be intimidating.’

If they thought that things I do,
If they’ve imagined the carnage that I have, 
They would know that I wasn’t and am not kidding.


Even if I couldn’t complete the task with my current abilities, I would try.


They have the nerve to criticize me and emotionally tear me down.


It takes so much time for me to regain my confidence.

And those same people dare wonder why am afraid of society in all its forms.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.903792142868042

Then he was like ""yeah betam as a sister"" I'm not the type of girl that confess But I just did it...then I told him we can't be friends but even after that one day he kissed me on the cheek unexpectedly then again he called another time and said ""I just wanna check if you are fine""  but I'm confused is he just leading me on........in our friendship time I used to be like I'm not serious in r/ship I'm just having fun.....Maybe that's what keeping him away?!...I miss him so much these days  what do you think should I start our friendship? even though it hurts or should I wait?",confusion,NEGATIVE,0.9883196353912354

So this is not a vent but just sth i feel we can all benefit from. A good friend of mine once told me one of the best ways to get over someone is to work on urself. See mostly we say we miss someone when its not really them we miss, we miss how they made us feel about ourselves. Thats because most of us dont really love ourselves, and thats why we feel like we need the validation to be okay. So work on being the best version of urself so u can see just how great u are and how u deserve sth amazing and not just a half assed effort from someone. The person u love shouldnt complete ur life, they should only be enhancing it. Soooo look in the mirror and that person u see staring back at u is really all thats standing in the way of u having a happy life. Hope this helps someone!",optimism,POSITIVE,0.9870742559432983

So I know this might not be as important as all of the vents above so I do apologize if by any means I offend someone(people do get aggressive for no reason in this channel).

So I guess what am trying to say is I been looking for scholarships online have got a couple but I have no one I can talk it over with, thus if y'all have some ideas you can point out on where I should go or who I should  talk to I would appreciate it .

So here's my story. I'm 14 and for most of last year I was depressed because one my friends committed suicide and then some others things happened too. This year I met this boy and I had a crush on him and apparently he did too and we started dating and he became my boyfriend. A dream come true right? Wrong. He's the sweetest most amazing person and he has a heart of gold. And I think that I might be falling in love with him. But the thing is that our relationship isn't evolving. It's been 4 months and we've only kissed once ! we just say hi to each other and we don't talk for the rest of the day but then he walks me to the school gate.  And I told him that if he doesn't make an effort I was done. And he still hasn't done anything and to be honest he has hurt me a couple of times in the past like at some point he spent more time with this other girl and whenever we were together she would always be there with us and we would never get any time alone and he would give her more attention and it really fucked me up.   but it's over now. But he really likes me in fact he told me that he loved me and today I was contemplating breaking up with him but then in class I didn't study the poem that we were given so when the teacher called me, he volunteered to take my place and he didn't know it well either and it was the sweetest thing ever. And then I accidentally told him that I loved him. i just feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm like the worst human being, he's way too good for me and last week was my friend's death anniversary and I'm so fucking depressed and I'm just trying to put on a fake smile. But honestly It's been so hard to do anything lately and I just feel like he deserves so much better than a depressed girl who is afraid to love him because she's already lost too much. But I feel like if I break up with him I'll regret it. And he's going to be betam hurt and it just breaks my heart even thinking about hurting him. I'm confused.

So there was this guy I talked to for about almost a year in the past we never really labeled our relationship and to this day I don't really know what it was but I liked it that way. He used to text me all the time all day all night. The thing that bugged me was he was posting random girl photos while he was talking to me at first I thought it was a sister but then I thought how many sisters a guy can have and I chose to let that slide. Things went on and he told me he liked me. But it was too soon for me. And he went with it and we talked for a lot after that. And some time later he started being all cold and stuff so I asked why he talks when he feels like it and shuts me out when he feels like it. Then we got into an argument and we stopped talking. That's when I realized I had actual feelings for him. 3 months later I decided to reconnect and talk again but it was the same with him he never even made an effort so I gave up. Now I'm at a phase where I'm cyber stalking him checking his profile pictures all the time. I try deleting his number and move on. Too bad I already memorized it. I can't seem to move on. I still think about telling him how I feel (he doesn't know) but it's been long since we talked and I think it'll be awkward to try to start up a conversation of the blue (since I tried once again and it never really worked). What should I do??",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9983494281768799

I've been a part of this vent group for a while now and not only speaking from experience but also hearing some of the stories shared I've seen a common underlying factor which I had to share. Niggas ain't shit, let me repeat that for you people out there, those hopeless romantics thinking they can change a guy or that guy they are always thinking about, thinking he will change or that he forgot to call you cause he was busy or whatever excuse your romantic comedy fried brains have thought of. He didn't, until you accept that baby girl the cycle will continue. 
I am not some pessimist, im a realist. Some of you might think this is an unfair generalisation and you might be right so let me amend my previous statement and say most niggas aint shit. So once you accept that your lives will be a hella lot easier and less worrisome.

There seriously needs to be an option on here for an interactive comment section. I couldn't let some of the comments some of u guys left behind go unanswered to. First off for the dude trying to throw shade and saying u ain't no angle the fact that u would get defensive shows that you are the niggas I was referring to. I was not saying I was an angel but i have made mistakes like anyone but at least I'm honest about them. These niggas i refer to would rather die than admit when they have fucked up, to much pride and ego, and I don't think girls are expecting too much when all they ask at least the average girl,is someone who is faithful n treats her nice nigga u need to check urself. And to the dude talking about community pussy bruh who u been hanging around,probably u be doing the same shit but just cause she beat you at your own game your out here throwing shade, grow up.
And to the third dude who thinks we always play the victim that does tend to be the case but you know deep down in ure heart that we are right. The amount of times you think or do shady shit in a day is simply incredible, I have like 99% guy friends so I'm pretty insinc with y'all behaviour. Girls can be shady too no doubt but trust that shadiness started when some homeboy with sweet personality and slick words did her dirty. At least generally that's what happens. Bisual cause y'all be watching these insanely fake girls that are the furthest thing from real n try n get that n when the girl doesn't give u that u move on some like a true dude telling her straight up but most of y'all do those dumb immature games.

This might sound weird for some. Whenever some girl teen girl is loosing/talking about having her first time sex, I get kinda deeply sad and feel guilty for the person doing them. And then I feel dumb and blame my self for being judgemental.Honestly, I shagged a lot of girls in the past (in highschool and college) but I whenever I came across a virgin I use to genuinely ask my self if I would be a long term partner; the answer was mostly no for most of them. So I stop whatever we're doing in bed and only start make out. I did that for years on many young girls. I had a belief "" if she's a virgin let a man who genuinely loves her enjoy her"" But just recently, I fall in love and we dated for almost two years. She wasn't a virgin cuz she did it with her highschool bf and then fuck a lot afterwards. And I felt truly bothered sometimes (for 2 years) because I do love her and I don't want to take her past against her. But, there is this emasculating feeling whenever I think about her first time and wonder how good it would have been if I was her first. All my life, I use to pass on virgin girls because I don't  want their boyfriend to feel the way I am feeling now. And now what? This is what I get in return? Fuck this derom akiton adelem eko...

Why do you think we as a society associate getting darker with being sick or we automatically assume someone's cute because they are 'key' (light skinned) and use terms like 'baria' to call friends who are darker which as I see it used among friends but still means slave... why do we associate being 'key' to being beautiful.

See what I don't get is why you set yourself up for disappointments when it's obvious am lying! Of course I won't tell you am with her. Why didn't you walk away the first time I did it, why did you stay? Why don't you just walk away? Why do you keep coming back after all that I have done to you, you know it's not like amma stop. You know am bad for you. Yet still you want to save me when I don't need saving. The only person who needs saving is you! from me, you weren't like this when we met, I see your soul slowly fading day by day demo I told you from the first time we met. It's like your addicted to these violent delights. Violent delights have violent ends. It's not like amma get tired of hurting you if you enjoy getting hurt setting yourself up for more misery and pain, your light is running out,boo. It truly saddens me that you don't see it when it's right under your nose, expectations are killing you love.  And I thought you were smart when your clearly not. The first step of solving a problem is knowing that there is one, am that cancer you know exist and let thrive in your life boo, cut me out. Maybe I will feel something then, relief.

It's been a little over than a week now. I have never felt this lonely in my life. It's like you are living as if I don't exist. It's as if your life would be much better without me in it. And I, being the fool that I am, keep hoping you'd come back. It hurts. The waiting, the disappointment and the rejection I feel is incomparable to nothing I have felt before. But what hurts the most is knowing that to lose you is so easy. I stuck with through it all but you couldn't wait to run away the moment things went bad. I knew this was too good to be true even when we didn't have good days. I am sorry I hurt you but I am more sorry I hurt myself for thinking you could love me in my bad days.

Why do people borrow your stuff if they are not going to take good care of it? Why? Why? Why? Why not buy your own stuff? Why are people like this? This is so selfish and unacceptable!!!!! 
I always have one rule before getting angry! 1st i observe the person and if they are careless with their own stuff then it's ok‍, you know what to expect! No need for the anger.  
  What annoys‍ me is people who treat my stuff differently as if it's free!"" If they are careful with their own, then they should be careful with mine too"" that's just respect yo!, is that so hard to ask?    Why are most people like this?

Okay so im the kinda girl that hides her feelings n writes them out, ive been doing this since i had depression which was four years ago n im 16 y/o now. I keep having dark thoughts and i always write them out n sometimes it worries me bc im kinda happy with my life but those dark feelings never go away n i feel like i may lose my mind if i dont write them. so anyways i have this book which i write on, yesterday i had a major argument with my mom and i felt so messed up then at night me mom n dad were in the same room n i was writing all those fucked up shits bc ik they wont wanna read them. Ik that bc I've always asked them if they wanna read what i write bc my dream is to be an author but they made it clear to me that they give 0 fucks abt what i like to do. And while i was writing, mom demanded to know what it says n i couldnt say no. She told me to give it to dad so he could read it, i had no choice so i did. And then they automatically assumed that i have some mental problem. I mean idk maybe i do but they were like bezi edmesh endezi miyachenaneksh mn ale, mn godelebsh, le stress menged mtkefchilet anchi nesh mnamn.... N i got so mad n said some stuff like ""ive been writing for four yrs n u cant assume uk what i feel n think just by reading half a page"".. It rly pissed me off bc they never offered to be there for me bc they were too busy when i was suicidal. I went thru it all by myself n they here like ""when weren't we ever there for u? We talk everyday, how can u say u have no one to talk to?"" They dont know how hard it is to open up to ur parents abt sth messed up, it's not easy to explain with words how messed up i feel n they think im just mekenatating. What worries me now is that they think imma mabed mnamn from all the stress (always concentrating on school, movies, music, phone, and now they know abt what i write) n i never let my brain rest.

Hey so im a female. 19,a senior in high school. I usually dont leave my house as my parents are strict, home to school and school to home is my longest trip. So a year ago my parents hired a new zebegna, as i am the only child at home i have no one to spend my time with and anyone to go out with as my parents wont let me he was the one i spent most of my time with. So i would spend most of my time in our big house alone usually outside playing and talking with the new zebegna. No one but the servants stay home so we'd talk with freedom. He is the most kind hearted person i have ever met. He is in this situation because of the waves of life and luck. So we started by flirting then followed kissing. Months later i found myself in love with him. He opened up about his feeling. One night snuck out to his room and and we slept together. I love him and want to be with him. But i know my parents wont accept this because of our different level of life standard. Im stuck,confused and dont knw what to do. Never shared this to my friends or anyone.

So i asked my mother about it and told me a story about how this werehyenas where transformed, how they make people their slave and how werehyenas change their slave to pot when at night and guests are arround and change them back to human to work as a slave.. Then i asked some relative of mine that night then he told me he was up late walking to his home and one old lady came up he was looking at her from far and she stand on dusty part of the ground and she started pulling her hair she fell down teferagetech botaw aboara bcha hone and she got up as a hyena and left running.. I was thinking so does this guy lie? At that night i sat with my laptop all night googling and found a lot of documentary lots of books written on this topic. Surprisingly i found everything in my mother and my relative told me in the books and documentary specially the northern part of ethiopia mentioning ""buda"" the mesmerizing eye.. In the book this guys called buda they eat your flesh and blood with their eyes and their many ways to attack their victims one is making you fall in love so you would meet much often while meeting their will be an eye contact sucking the blood with their eyes you won't live long.. Another is being a hyena and sucking a blood after the victims death the grave will be dug and they pray to their god the killer will turn into hyena then the victim will come back to life and be their slave for 7 years the slave will cry everyday with out tears being seen after 7 days the slave will be killed.. Many slaves means rich pride in the buda community says the books i read and many more about shekone egr yalachew sewoch..  on Wikipedia it says that - in Ethiopia it is traditionally believed that a wizard or witch with the power to change into hyena and most of them are blacksmith and rob graves at midnight are referred as buda buda as a men or a women who turns nightly into hyena and resumes human shape at dawn and in western sudanic peoples there is a hybrid creature, a human who nightly transform into cannabalistic monster that terrorizes peiple these werehyenas are also found in sudan Tanzania morocco..

Haloo, so to this day the most daunting thing about being an atheist is all the stupid questions I hear. You get asked questions like 'well if there's no god what's to stop me from raping?' And then there are the slightly harder questions like 'if there's no god then what do you live for?' I can never understand if these people actually don't understand the idiocy of their questions or if they're just purposefully trying to irritate me.
I am an atheist, as far as I'm concerned there is no god, there are no ghosts, and there are no spirits. And as a response to the what do you live for question. I do not exist to be the plaything of a giant that lives in the sky. I live for myself, for the things I can do, for the people I can help. If for nothing else, then I live for the family that worked themselves halfway into their graves just so they could raise me. That's the beauty of atheism you get to choose what you want to dedicate yourself to. The irony of the question you ask me is that I actually have more reasons to live than a person that lives 'for god'.

Some times I go to the living room and turn on the TV and just sit thereI... That kind of stuff.. it was funny for a long time my parents got use to it cuz I never do anything harmful. My siblings recorded me show in the morning I remembered nothing at all for a long time it was like this. So when I get to the point I have gf now and she knows about this never bothered us... But lately she heard me ""dirty talking"" to someone in my sleep not a real person just some one from a movie ... Dreams work in weird ways.... She got pissed at me and now she is not talking to me saying it's like I cheated on her. So ppl what do u think does it make me a horrible person. And guys I know u can relate...

There is nothing as pathetic as knowing a woman will occupy your thoughts for the rest of your life. Every thing you have done in life was in some way a call for her attention. And the more indifferent she seemed the more you become driven to achive anything worthy of her attention. 
Every night, you purposefully exhaust yourself that by the time your head hits your pillow you just shut down other wise you can't handle the pictures you see as your mind tries to put its self to sleep.
You often ask girls out so that everyone around you knows you are a functioning part of society. As you are getting ready to go to the dates, you look yourself in the mirror and smile at the absurdity of it all.
You sit across the table looking at girls who try hard not to look desperate but be interesting at the same time. Sometimes you kick yourself around for the way you treat this girls but most of the time you convince yourself to give them a good time as a way of atonement. You drink. You talk. You throw a couple of compliments at them. But by the end of the night a peck on the cheek is all you can offer. On your way back home your mind confidently weighs the girl you went out with against Her knowing that it was pointless in the first place.
On conversations with mutual friends you eagerly wait for her name to pop up, although you look dignified on the out side you are a kid on sugar, inside. You artfully push them on to talk more about her.
And when by chance you two meet the amount of energy you use to keep it all together would power a whole city. You sit and just watch her as she talks about everything thats going on in her life. You take it all in. her lips , her lively eyes... 
She would ask what you've been up to and you start talking, walking a thin line between being humble and bragging. But you can't help it you want her to know you're moving up in this world and that you are worthy.
After you said your goodbye you  pick a random road and start running. You run till your feet hurt and your heart feels like coming out your chest. All the while a million thoughts about her race through your mind.
When you get to your house, you refuse dinner that was offered and go straight to your bed  shutting  down immediately.",neutral,POSITIVE,0.9927767515182495

What the hell is all about this virginity kibad? Seriously men, y'all are gonna be like ""am not gonna marry her if she ain't a virgin"" while y'all out here fucking half of the city? Yawm the 14 year olds mnamn? Then you have the audacity to go around searching for one that hasn't fallen into your traps? 
And women, you seriously think that's how you will earn respect from men? By being virgins??? Yeah, he's alcholic and abusive but that will just evaporate once he knows you're a virgin. B, no! He's still going to beat the crap out of you and disrespect you and belittle you. The only way you get respect is by demanding it. Not when you open your legs and let him feel a hymn. That's just dumb. It's the 21st century. Things have changed. Be who the fuck you want to be. Get that dick, or don't. Ion give two fucks. Beza lay it's just so fucking annoying how a lot of females around here are all like ""he wont marry you if..."" as if our end goal is to marry a man and bear his fruits. (A feminist speech on the horizon) sorry to burst your little bubble but no, we are so much more than bearing children and kissing men's feet. We are the fucking future. Some women have ambitions and career goals. We think there are higher places than a man's feet or the kitchen. Some of us don't even want to have husbands. Or children. Not everybody wants to be somebody's wife. Some of us want to be our own people and conquer the world. All this shaming your sisters for having sex is just ridiculous.
Y'all ""religious people"" demo, good for you for wanting to be pure  until marriage. Just do not go around forcing that on the rest of us. I hope God sees that you've waited and blesses you beyond us. Truly. Just stop with this self-righteous blabbing. Ain't nobody got time for that. Jeez.
 Point is am sorry I can't see how you think it's your buisness to be criticising me cause am a sexually liberated woman of the 21st century, and honestly, if you got a couple of big Os yourself, you wouldn't be this bitter.

It's funny how someone can change from being your life line in this Godforsaken place, from being the person you want to see when you open your eyes in the morning, from being the last thing you think about when you close your eye lids at night, From being a torch in this darkness in to Nothing, literally nothing.  May be not ""nothing"" you are much more than that, maybe a Ghost, a Ghost of dead memories, A ghost of memories of the days were I needed you, memories of the days were I would take a bullet for you and die with a smile cause you would be safe, how could I have been so blinded, unable to see the person I would take a bullet for would pull the trigger. Oh, well.
 
 Gin love don't beat your self up as I accuse you of murder, love you killed the part of me that kept you alive and I love you for that, I finally said ""i love you"", eh? Demo saying it wasn't as bad as you said it would be, so I love you for killing me, now please watch as I enjoy slowly killing the memories of you. The ghost of your dead memories stay as they are a reminder, reminding me to never be weak again. Thank you for being a lesson. I will also not flinch when taking a life.

Hey everybody. So I was thinking, whenever I watch porn I see some stupid teenage girl making a stupid decision and the producers and studs taking advantage of a little girl. Or just some woman who has been molested when she was a baby girl or turned her life upside down by the savagery of life or a woman trying hard to support her family or her baby and still a fucking selfish producer trying to make profit out of their misery. So please dont involve in the culture and limad that beats such women down. Don be a part of it dont watch porn. Cuz any woman in a right mind and position would think its fine to be disgraced buy bunch of guys on a video that is to be streamed allover the world. At least not all of the stars.

So i have been thinking,  are we not allowed to have our own opinions anymore, do you have any idea how many times i nod my head for bullshit i do not agree on, i do it just to get along. Not to be called ignorant, people say shit like you are not open minded fuck that you're  the one who is not because you wouldn't even let me have my own opinion, i don't criticise other's way of thinking but i hate those who forces you to see things they way they do. For  example my atheist friends i don't go tell them how stupid they are that is their choice i don't care, i care about religion and i have my own way of life that is what i choose, but all they do is try to convince me i am wrong  
And also my homo friends if i ever said i am cool with it, i am only trying to feed in cause can't no body can speak their mind no more  , if i speak my mind and say i think that is wrong i will just be called ignorant and get criticized for having my own point of view.

2: He kinda keeps forgetting ma value. He takes me for granted until I makuref him then he goes back to being nice again for like a month or so till he forgets n take me for granted again. 
(Not making time to c me, not being romantic at all menamin)....he was like z most romantic guy the 1st 2 yrs n he wld go miles to c me even when I didn't deserve it back then but not anymore. 
Now me on the other hand wants to c him every chance I get n wld go miles to c him.  But he cancels if it's not convenient for him. ( I am not being clingy or anything tho)

Now my dilemma here is, is this normal or am being naive? 
Am blindly in love n I have the energy to keep going like this but I don't want to b stupid. 
Am I being stupid?? Shld I gather ma strength n break it off or live like this? 


PS: I talked to him gzillion times abt it but after a month menamin he goes back to it.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9964067339897156

I still feel bad about it. Me and you had lots of memories made and more to come ahead. We were so close but yet so far . We almost had something special. Although you rejected me on New years eve, I still think it's my fault to ask you out. We could have had one hell of a 2016 but it couldn't be. Then you found out what I did and porbably thanked yourself for rejecting me. I didn't meant to do it. I was an idiot for doing so anyhow. My close friend broke us apart and I wish he hadn't done that but it happened. Girl I regretted it for a while but decided it was enough an I learnt from it instead. I moved on from it and came close one more time. But it seemed like you couldn't leave it behind and I don't blame you.
If you was by my side, I would have done everything to make you happy. Unfortunately, time ran out and we went our separate ways.
I truly am sorry but my apology didn't seem to shed a small light on the darkness created by me.

Hey there my Habesha people. So I have a relationship'ish problem. I have been in a relationship for more than 2 year. My bae is everything that I imagine it to be. I have known him since I was a kid. We grew up in the same neighbourhood. There is not that much of age difference between us.(3 years) I love him. I really do. Imagine yourself being with a relationship with a person u have been crazy for before u guys became a thing. So his father lives in U.S.A. And his father got his family a green card. I knew eventually that he was gonna move there. But when the time came, I was broken. So he moved out of . We tried the long distance relationship thingy. But I feel like it is not going to work, like we are going to grow apart. I still love him, I really do. But I could not get these fear out of my head. Since I am pretty attached to him, I feel like we are not going to last 4ever. So few months ago I suggested that him and I should take a break. Like live our own lives until we see each other again. He was mad, super mad. But he accepted. But he still finds a way to talk to me. And since our conversation were very ""couple-like"" I tried my best to ignore him. I knew what I did was pretty selfish. He is hurt and so am I. I want to be with him but not like these. We may never see each other again. He is not going to move back here. And I am probably sure I have no chance to go to him. I am doing this Cuz it is the best thing to do. For him and me. He still is trying to talk to me and I am giving him and sign that I am not interested anymore(even though it is killing me up inside). So what should I do? I can't get him of my mind. I don't wanna date other dudes. I just want him back but life ain't always fair. So help to overcome my problem. Please! I am in need of help. 

And P.S I told him the reason why I am doing what I am doing.",love,NEGATIVE,0.8660485148429871

When people say try your best what they don't understand is my best is imprisoned in my mind with all my hopes and dreams and my depression holds the key. It dangles it in front of me but never within reach. I peak through the key hole and see my potential for greatness shriveled up and hiding in the corner, my dreams just shadows on the wall. I scream and kick at the door but it only opens for my depression. It goes in and lines up all its blades and cuts into my happy endings one by one untill they are just stains on the floor of my mind. My potential twists and shouts as my depression exercises every method of torture upon it. It tries to drown my hopes in a river of sad thoughts it pushes them in again and again til they are barely breathing and too weak to rise up. Then it washes its hands and and changes its bloody clothes and lockes up all the mess it made behind a steel door. It takes a stroll down my memories leaving bloody foot prints on each one, walks up and down til all are stained red. It slithers down my throat painting my airway with sooth, it wraps around my lungs giving them no space to move. It caresses my heart with it cold bony fingers sending it running into panic. It goes down to squeeze my stomach and ties my intestines together,  goes to my legs and makes my muscles shake till they are to week to carry me. It seeps into my bones like the piercing winter cold making me shiver and shake. 
When people say you're not trying your best or you have so much potential or you can do so much better...how do i tell them my better, my best is a cage made of the bones of my broken dreams tied together with all that potential. Somebody said that its often the tortured that become torturers and i have learned the art of torture from the master. But i have yet to burn my flesh to drown out the screams in my head. I have yet to cut open my vessels and let my blood quitely drain. I have yet to peal my skin and  rip open my chest and let my soul free. So why can't that be my best? Maybe  smiling through each day and surviving through the night is all the potential i have. Why isn't that enough? 
I am still here while it makes a home for itself inside me. I am still here while it imprisons my soul in this sack of meat. And while it beats my subconscious to a bloody pulp i do not let it bruise my face. I do not let the world know. I sit in the sunlight hoping to burn out the cold. I smile as it opens the door to start another day of barely held back tears. I laugh as it bathes in the blood of all my could bes, i even make a joke or two. I do my best.

I know imma sound like a spoiled teenager saying this but trust me I’m not. Atleast not anymore. I’ve gone through all those I hate my parents, no one understands me crap and I’ve gotten over it. More like made my peace with it. Don’t get me wrong I love my parents now lol. Aaanyways, I found the secret to happiness a while ago and that was *not giving a fuck*. I made sure I wasn’t hurting anyone with what I’m doing but I never gave anyone the chance to make me feel bad. Someone didn’t think I wasn’t beautiful or wasn’t dressed in something trending? Fuck him/her I don’t wake up to impress them‍.  Even when what someone said or did makes me feel bad I never showed it and gave them the satisfaction. I really didn’t care because I thought when I found mister right, he would understand me and that I wouldn’t have to be explaining why I did what I did all the time. I atleast thought when I did explain, he’d see things from my perspective. Yaw mayders neger yelem yehem derso i fell in love  I know he loves me too. Gin now I know love bicha minim ayseram. I swear to God I’ve never seen anyone who’s more Derek and someone who always thinks he’s right than he does. Even when it looks like I did something wrong and I try to explain why I did what I did (I swear on even the most legit reasons) it’s always me who’s wrong and ends up apologizing.

Hello fellow members. So let me cut straight to the chase. My problem is that this dude I know from school back in the days which I had a huge crush on suddenly came back to my life. And lately we have been spending time together. And now am seriously in love with him. But the problem is that he kinda is a player. And he talks to one of my friends to. And now she really likes him or may be in love... am scared that she might take him away from me because am a virgin and she’s not and he might get the things he want from her ... Soo help me brothers and sisters am lost. So should I stop the thing I have with him or what",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9932982325553894

So here is my question guys. How can a guy break up with a girl without hurting her feelings ? Because I've been in a rlshp for almost 6 months and she is madly in love with me but I don't have feelings for her. I already told her but she keeps insisting I wait for my love to develop .

I'm glad that someone finally created a platform like this so that our generation can VENT! we are told here and there not to speak what we want. But at least Thinking is not yet illegal So I'm glad to express myself here...to speak what cause is bothering me and what I think about it. 
I'm a medical student...and also a girl. And there is one thing I face almost everyday of my life...not only me but almost every girl in my class...
Case #1 You examine your patient and they ask you some questions concerning their health. And if you know anything, you'll tell me. But then another male med student examine them, he is by default better than you. They trust him, not you...Male+doctor>female+doctor?

Case#2 When people ask you about your studies and if you tell them that you learn at a hospital...""oh, you're a nursing student!""...will be their answer. 
So...I don't get it...
Girl+working in/learning a health field= nurse  Vs   Boy+learning in a hospital= a medical doctor???
And nurses are NOT by any means underprivileged than a doctor. Doctors can't do their job without nurses...

Anyways...there are lots of cenarios I can tell you. But I think you understand what I mean. 
If you think that there is gender equality, think again. Everything should be considered only under one parameter...Being a human!!!
Our generation still needs a healing...not a physical one...an mental healing. It all starts from thoughts. I hope we all as millennial, we'll fight against this . Thank you!",optimism,NEGATIVE,0.9523910284042358

It's not really a vent but just wanted to impart some wisdom... So the Golden Gate Bridge is famous for people jumping off it. There was a man who wanted to kill himself and went on the bridge to do it. He stood on the rails looking down on the water and thinking about his troubles in life. He decided to end it all and jumped but as soon as his body started falling down and the inevitable end was closing in he realized the only thing in his life he couldn't change was the decision he just made. But luckily he survived the fall and got a second chance in life. I read many vents about  people wanting to kill themselves but you should know there is nothing in this world that can't be changed.

As a functioning-scratch that -well functioning human being anyone is exposed to there own innate ability of self awareness and observation. These observations may lead to the stage of self hatred and depression. A strong person will co front these feelings and go with what their logic tells them to do after well consideration of their situation and also other inputs that matter. It takes a level of contemplation and intuition to tackle one's problems not looking for a channel with 6 thousand sorry people that lack these characteristics and feed off the fact that there are people as weak or even weaker than they are and make themselves feel better. No one wants to hear about your vagina or your second dick between your ass crack. But they might want to hear how you dealt with it and how that introduced a different level of observing and acting upon the world for you. So please stop this sick spiral you all are feeding and try and focus on how to solve the problems and-with respect to all of u-stop bitching like the emotionally insecure slimy fucks you all are and get up and do something about it.

Hello strangers, can't believe I'd ever vent here but here we go.

I've went to number of hospitals to get rid of it but it's untraceable. Now that I've learned to know that it's impossible for doctors to remove it, I've developed this traumatic phobia of magnets for it makes me think I'll stick to it.

I'm a terribly lost kid in life and I'm fucking bloody mad at everything but I'm just too lazy to take action. My life's mess starts with my birth certificate, I got two, one says I'm 17 and another says I'm 16 but all in all its just a ludicrous, which one should I take?, parents told me I'm 16 but I'm a senior student, like how, I mean there is a rational explanation, and there must be one.

The mess goes on with my character, to be honest I'm just either stupid or trust too much in having any doubt on friends or families, and when someone shows me a smile, I just get obsessed with them and I don't know why, I mean it's just a fuckin smile, but I still get on. I have friends who calls me crazy  while in fact I lost myself half a decade ago, and I feel pretty stupid abt everything, then went on to numbness which I have no idea where it came from, and everything I say either makes me a racist or an idiot, but I don't think I'm that insane to do those things, but in actuality boom.......I'm just throwing offensive shots everywhere.

Not only that but most of the people I help just keep on getting better than I am and I feel angry about it, like they begged for my help so I help em, but when I ask for theirs they're like 'got not shit' then they get better outcomes.

Well so I have issues ... but who doesn't right
The thing is I'm a book nerd like fiction and stuff not school 
Anyways u might not think it's a bad thing being addicted to books ur probably thinking this isn't something worth venting about 
But just listen or read


So I used to read 20 -30 books per week at first it was all good  and it made me happy the stories and the part that it drives me to another world was just amazing forgetting everything and being in a world I wanted to be in but after a while (1 year in exact) I started to get depressed with out a book 2 days with out a book and I turn to a depressed zombie walking..
This addiction has ruined a lot of stuff in my life like relationships 
I read so many cliche and lovey dovey books I forgot what reality was like
I used to be a bitch to my bf just because he didn't do anything like those guys in the books
And I used to be mad at my friends for not understanding me like those friends did in the books
I used to be so disrespectful to my parents just because they weren't cool as those in the books
And I used to bully my sister just because most of the big sisters did that to their lil sisters in the books

After a while my parents started to realize So they  took away my books phone tab ... everything I had books on .... for 5 months ... imagine how I acted all those 5 months but in the end it helped me ... 
don't get me wrong I love books I still read 1 in 2 weeks but I'm just saying just because hearing what u wanted to hear and watching what u wanted to see and reading what u wanted to be true is never gonna take u out of reality .....
The shity world still awaits us in the end .... I had to learn the hard way to accept that",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9587162733078003

I am 19 and i had been in a relationship for a while, 3 month to be exact, but i hadnt been fully into the relationship. I mean i like the guy, i really did, i still think about him somedays, but ive been told that i wasnt good enough for so long that no matter what he said, no matter how much he complimented me, i cldnt take it to heart. Infact, whenever he calls me beautiful or how lucky he is mnamn, i feel like he was mood eyeyazebgn neger. Siqetl demo my mom and dad were not in love when they agreed to get married. They fight a lot and say very hurtful things to each other that breaks them for the long run. And whenever i tell my mam that i wont be getting married, she has never tried to change my mind. Besides, ive been through a lot before and ive got scars all over my body to prove it, which makes me wonder if anyone will ever love me enough to accept me the way I am.

So here goes my fucked up love life. I'm 25 and I've been with my gf for over 5 years now and we never had sex or anything and we love eachother very much. I wanted but she kept giving me the cold shoulder every time saying she wanted to be a virgin till marriage. After sometime I stopped asking and was at peace with her wish. So last month one day she told me she was going out with a couple of her friends at a club (girls night bela) I said okay have fun then I didn't hear from her for the rest of the night. The next day I called her in the after noon and she wouldn't pick up so I called her friend and asked her about the night and stuff. I could hear the shame and fear of her friend in her voice so I asked what was wrong...she hanged up on me. Then later that day I heard from her other friends that she slept with a guy she met at the club (one night stand). 
I was completely heart broken. The girl that was supposed to be a virgin till marriage, the girl I was gonna marry one day, the girl that told me she loved me till death....cheated on me with a complete stranger...she wasn't influenced by any drinks or drugs btw...bc she doesn't drink nor do drugs.
I've never felt so low in my life. It took her 2 weeks to finally call me which I didn't pick up...and now she is crying and begging for my forgiveness and I don't know what the fuck I should do.

Its soo hard, what keeps me going is my friends because at homs its like am an outsider i admit that am different and weird, childish,  and sometimes immature but thats just my fun side, when i get serious i get serious,  but then my mom pulls me down again! And it takes me a long time to recover from her painful words! And i dont know what to do?!  So help me",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9804542660713196

How can i feel like this just at the beginning of my life. Im Just 18 yet sometimes I feel like I have felt everything there is to feel and all thats left is a hollow emptied version of those. Excitement, sorrow, happiness are all just a memory for me. Should I be thankful about the stagnant life I live despite how barren it is or should I risk the heights in search of the adrenaline rush. After all, all emotions are jus mere chemicals in my body and nothing has an intrinsic value in life...including life but should I let this ultimate truth hold me back from living like other han beings that attribute emotions to something more than the physical body. Ignorance is indeed Bliss. This Dilemma haunts me, my nihilist-stoic veiw of this world has taken its toll.

Hey guys, am a girl n 24. What i want to share might b a bit strange to all of u. Here is the thing. Idk y bt i dnt have a gd feelin bout my mother. Am now independent n like that bt she never seem to leave me alone. She kinna always calls n ask me where i am n doin what? That's nt only it, she was so abusive when i was a child, both verbally n physically. Plus she always acts like she's the innocent one while am the bad guy. All those things make me the way i am now. Sm one shy, unable to relax, fearful, nt sociable n soooo reserved w/c impacts my life negatively. She never appreciated things i did, she always underestimated everythin n clearly discriminated me from my lil brother. On the other hand, i can't deny that she is very strong, for raising three kids on her own. Gin demo, she kinna go out with different guys since i cn remember well. That really made me hate her to date. Ywmigermew, she tries to still act like an innocent n expect me to b like one. I hate my mother that's  it! N sm times i feel like i want to get her put from my life telling her all i know. I have these thoughts i mind (thinking what she put me through in the past) to ruin everything with her.

Hi everyone ...There is this girls ... so we knew each other since elementary school & we were good friends, but some of her friends started a rumor that am in love with her & she stopped talking to me ever since.  After 7 years later she Facebooked me told me how sorry she was for the way she acted. I didn't mind so we started talking nager. .. long story short she was in a rough patch so I tried to help her ... I tried to be there for her but in the process I fallen in love with her ... we acted like couple talking every day flirting  ... giving each other nick names. But most of the time it seems she was playing games with me ... she bails out at the last min when ever we were going to meet... she doesn't pick up the phone when I call ... so I got fed up with it & decided to tell her how I feel ...she was not willing to met so I wrote her a long text explaining everything & she told me she likes me but she is in a complicated relationship. This broke me ! Previously  I had asked her if she was in one, but she dined. So I told her I will be there 4 her when ever she needs help, but I can't keep on playing pretend couple. What she said was she likes me ... her feeling 4 me is more than as friend, but she can't be with me b/c of the BF gin ""atleast let's  be friend"". How can I be friends with the girl I love... so I told her I can't continue doing this... she said she don't want to loss me that she needed me in her life & asked not to leave her ... but we stopped talking since that day ...

But I straight up lied cause I thought it wasn't my place to tell. he was so desperate that he told me he's going to go there to talk to her (800 kilo meters btw) eventho she told him not to come. Again I said noting. Finally she told him that she's got a new bf. But he thinks that she's just saying it just to make him mad. I wanna tell him it's true But I already told him like a 100 times that I don't know shit n I can't just say I was lying. So Now even she told him the truth n I'm stuck lying for her.

The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A death! What's that, a bonus?!? I think the life cycle is all backwards. You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you go live in an old age home. You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, then, when you start work, you get a gold watch on your first day.  You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You drink alcohol, you party, and you get ready for High School. You go to primary school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little boy(girl), you go back, you spend your last 9 months floating with luxuries like central heating, spa, room service on tap, then you finish off as an orgasm!!

So lately i’ve been having troubles with a lot of thing, i don’t even know when it all went wrong my life literally flipped. I always end up getting hurt when i open up to people but i can’t just bottle my feelings and act like i’m okay at some point i have to say something about it. Growing up i always had to witness my parents fighting and it always ends up physical, my dad is not a bad person tho and i love him but because of him i have issues with trusting men, and the one time i actually decided to let my guards down and tell him about everything but it back fired and i got hurt in the worst ways even the people i considered best friends had done nothing but use me or hurt me solemnly. And for that reasons i keep quite about every thing including how i feel or even if anything goes wrong i keep quite or cry myself to sleep and i’m not really a cryer.

I’m embarrassed of myself. My boyfriend set up a date to introduce me to his friends. I’m usually an outgoing person and I never get nervous in front of new people but I pretty well messed the date up. His friends are… so “exotic” that it was too difficult for me to befriend them. In fact I got sensitive about their personality hence tried so hard to impress them talking in a way that isn’t me, making stupid jokes that any person with a horrible sense of humor wouldn’t make and masgemeted myself. They even gave me a nickname that never suits with my character and go like “ehhh esua lij” whenever someone mentions my name. My personality changed after that as I started avoiding people (even my friends) and guys as I think of myself as bothersome and dim-witted. My conversations are short with unwitty and sensitive jokes accompanied with annoyed facial expression making people think that I’m mad at them when I’m clearly not and shun me. So generally I’m unhappy about my social life. It’s already been three months since i met his friends but I couldn’t get over it and sometimes they even appear in my dreams. I really hoped to meet them again or text them as to reconciliate since that’s the only way I can forget the whole lot and be in a peace of mind, but since my boyfriend won’t be okay with it, I already gave up on that. I also tried to tell him the entire thing but couldn’t since he might misunderstand and take my 3 months old unrealistic and unnecessary worries for something else and suspect my innocent thoughts. I’m really clueless about what I should do right now. Please help me! Okay let’s say I can’t prove them that i’m fun and it’s alright if they give me names or say whatever they want but at least i’d love to return to being my old me where people love me and don’t take the jokes I make seriously.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9968534111976624

Do you my fellow Ethiopians know what happened at this day before 81 years?? In 1929 Ethiopian Calendar Well...following an attempted assassination of Marshal Rodolfo
Graziani and Marchese di Neghelli who were in control of Italian East Africa including Ethiopia; In which the attempted assassination was led by Abraham Deboch and Moges Asgedom. The Itallians responded with one of worst massacre in Ethiopian history. On the next three days the Itallians had killed 30,000 Ethiopians in only Addis Ababa, they were ordered to kill any Ethiopian they found. The quote reads ""...for three days I give
you carte blanche to destroy and kill and do what
you want to the Ethiopians."" They doused native houses with petrol and set
them on fire. Well a lot happened on this day to our Great Great Grand Fathers and Mothers. Its our duty to at least know our History and memorize them. ጀግኖች አትዪጲያዉያን አትረሱም!!! የካቲት 12!",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9984171390533447

I've been reading going through the vents here and a majority of them are about relationships. so here is a little something I've taken from all those vents
1. girls like guys other gitls like
she will tell you she doesn't like players. she'll even tell herself she hates players but don't you for a minute believe it's true. like  any hot product girls want what is tried and tested. so go out and socialise and get yourself a couple of girls that will spread the tales of your awesomeness( ok that was too much)
2. when it comes to relationships girls are confused af
sometimes they don't even know why they like you. some of them might even be with you cuz they'll get good press
3. girls love sex. a lot
stop guilt tripping yourself by thinking that you are a sex addict in the relationship. they want it too, just don't make them feel like ""sluts"" when doing it.
4. NO such thing as an ""innocent girl""
stop treating her like an angel and start treating her like the human being she is
5. as long as they think they love you, most girls are down to get frisky
6. don't give up
like i said most of them are confused and spend most of their time venting whether they should give you another chance or not. so don't throw in the towel just yet
7. they are very self conscious about thier body. make sure you don't fuck up by running your mouth
8. virginity has a lot of value attached to it so be careful  not to trigger any "" omg I'm a slut"" feelings when you decide to venture into new lands( or caves idk)
9. stop hating on the players. learn from them. for all their short comings they seem to be getting laid very often
10. be fucking bold
for all the talk about gender equality and girl power, girls still expect you to do the balzy shit like asking them out, going in for the kiss and initiating sex.
they go for the guy with balls(ik too much) not the guy who talks to her about how school was or ""ምን አዲስ ነገር አለ"" on every freaking text.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9964011907577515

It's not really a vent but just wanted to impart some wisdom... So the Golden Gate Bridge is famous for people jumping off it. There was a man who wanted to kill himself and went on the bridge to do it. He stood on the rails looking down on the water and thinking about his troubles in life. He decided to end it all and jumped but as soon as his body started falling down and the inevitable end was closing in he realized the only thing in his life he couldn't change was the decision he just made. But luckily he survived the fall and got a second chance in life. I read many vents about  people wanting to kill themselves but you should know there is nothing in this world that can't be changed.

Hey there my Habesha people. So I have a relationship'ish problem. I have been in a relationship for more than 2 year. My bae is everything that I imagine it to be. I have known him since I was a kid. We grew up in the same neighbourhood. There is not that much of age difference between us.(3 years) I love him. I really do. Imagine yourself being with a relationship with a person u have been crazy for before u guys became a thing. So his father lives in U.S.A. And his father got his family a green card. I knew eventually that he was gonna move there. But when the time came, I was broken. So he moved out of . We tried the long distance relationship thingy. But I feel like it is not going to work, like we are going to grow apart. I still love him, I really do. But I could not get these fear out of my head. Since I am pretty attached to him, I feel like we are not going to last 4ever. So few months ago I suggested that him and I should take a break. Like live our own lives until we see each other again. He was mad, super mad. But he accepted. But he still finds a way to talk to me. And since our conversation were very ""couple-like"" I tried my best to ignore him. I knew what I did was pretty selfish. He is hurt and so am I. I want to be with him but not like these. We may never see each other again. He is not going to move back here. And I am probably sure I have no chance to go to him. I am doing this Cuz it is the best thing to do. For him and me. He still is trying to talk to me and I am giving him and sign that I am not interested anymore(even though it is killing me up inside). So what should I do? I can't get him of my mind. I don't wanna date other dudes. I just want him back but life ain't always fair. So help to overcome my problem. Please! I am in need of help.

Am an atheist and I was wondering why everyone always jumps to the conclusion that there has to be a creater for everything but not realize that their arguments are cyclic as they have to explain then ""who the hell created the creator!"". If you are smart enough to ask (courageous enough would be the right word cause I know everyone does ask this but is afraid to answer it logically) yourselfs this then you'll end up with the answer that at one point something has to come out of nothing.

I fell for an enchanting girl, but she had already fallen head over heels for my best friend. He and she are now in an intimate relationship and they are adorable. They are a symbol of true love in the making.
Most of all, i believe in an unrequited love but i just can't seem to get her off my head. Every time she smiles and speaks, she rekindles the flame which i have been trying so hard to suppress. I will always care for her one or the other way and  Everyone knows of my unfettered affection for her, she even views me as brother. I have made a great deal of progress at moving on. But how can i actually move on for the better?
How can i say no when she asks smthg off me?
How can i turn my back when she calls me?
I know she needs me as a brother to help her through her daily life but my friends, around me, mock my dedication to her as an attempt made to subvert.
But the truth is: when she calls, i answer; when she requests, i fullfill.

People think am weird and i like being weird, i fit in but nobody knows the real me, i only share what they want me to share, i only say what they want to hear, helped me but sometimes hurts me because i can only be my true self when am alone, and when i act how they want me to act they believe they can use me as they want and i let them because i don't have the courage to say no! The worst part is that its to late for me to show my true self (atleast thats what i think)  I've been ignored, betrayed, hurt,mad fun of, and i dont expect anyone to understand, because i know am different and i like that but i also want to fit in and be like everybody else, i sometimes imagine that i am in another world and i am a different person sometimes the person who everyone liked, or who every one hated, drop ur opinions and tell me what type of person u think i am!!!",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9978877902030945

My fellow Christians, I got a series of questions for you. How does our Lord really feel about the Devil? Does God hate Satan? If God does not love Satan, how could God be maximally and perfectly good? (If God does not love one being, then HE cannot be maximally and perfectly good.) Plus, how can God teach us to love our enemies when He hates His own enemy? On the other hand, if God loves Satan, how could a good God love the evil Satan? Furthermore, if God loves Satan, should we also love Satan? The Bible does not fully address this question, so I'm asking it not to stir doubts but to increase our knowledge and faith in God.",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9947128891944885

I can't believe I'm bout to vent about a guy, I'm usually the girl who goes when I see a vent about guys or relations.Well it is what it is I guess. So my best friend of 7 years has a guy best friend she grow up with and since we have same religion n she wanted her 2 best friends I don't know... Be together I guess she offered to set us up which I said no too of course. The fact that she thought we will hit it off cause we follow same religion kinda pissed me off n she backed off. 7 or 8 month ago she told me they start dating n 5 week ago we( me,him,her n others) hangout for the first time, thanks to the brilliant idea of my besti attempting to set us up things were weird between us so we never really even talked before that, but that day we end up talking one on one and u would think it would be awkward given my awkward antisocial personality n... But it wasn't we actually clicked. So we start talking n before I knw it we're texting everyday even talk on the phone sometimes and whenever the guilt creeps in I tell my self "" we're just talking nothing else n she would totally be okey with it"" but that was BS I know I would never tell her we text practically till mid night almost everyday. After a week ""just talking""changed to ""just hanging out"" but by then the guilt was too much so I told my self I'm gonna stop n even talked to him about it but, he  said ""nothing wrong with just talking that we're friends"" but we both knw it was a lie we used , so I just start avoiding him ignoring his text but the more I push the more he keeps coming back n the more I like it I tried so hard not, but it become a cycle I couldn't get out off so the only way was to text n tell him I might be developing feelings for him n that I don't want to be that gal who snick behind her friend & that it's best if we just stop & I told him to not bother to even reply. I blocked him on telegram n that was it so I thought... I couldn't stop obsessing about him i keep reading our texts back I was miserable n it only been 4 days I have never felt like this it was  crazy!! I missed him so bad & I thought it was it for us but this morning I was on a taxi line n he texted me & the craziest most insane thing happened I saw his text n I swear I cried right there in the spot I couldn't help it & I am not an emotional person. small shit like this don't make me cry it was so weird so out of character so of course i was convinced I have feelings for him so I texted him back n now I'm back in the cycle n I don't know what to do...

What i don't get is why God gives us things that we never asked for, just so that we adapt to it, we make our lives around it, call it a blessing, call it a gift, we thank God for it, and just then he takes it away making us devastated, its too painful you know the pain, that sinking pain that eats you alive, he makes us go thorugh all that, and i ask whats the point?

Some people are going through a lot and the fact that they got the courage to say what they feel to get support and advice instead of insults?  
Isn't it wrong judging a 15 year old girl and telling her that she is a mistake and immature and embarrassment to her family? 
Some people are commenting on things they don't agree with instade of what they think and advice!

This is to all those nice girls and guys out there who are constantly taken for granted, ""betrayed"", and ""disrespected.""
. So your whole life you have been the one who cares most in any relationship.
. you have never made a mistake. You have been the outstanding student. The good child. The good friend. 
. You want to be there for everyone. But you don't accept any kind of help. You don't want to be a ""burden.""
. you spent many sleepless nights worrying about the one time you were ""mean"" to someone.
 . you don't acknowledge the things you achieved in case you offend someone.
. you are the listener. You listen to everyone but when you speak no one is there to listen. You listen too much now you have lost your voice.
. you don't tell people when they have hurt your feelings bcuz you don't ""like"" conflict.
Okay, now nice girls and guys WAKE UP! Who are you kidding with your ""I am the one who cares a lot"" and "" I am the victim ""???? Most of you are all People pleasers searching for the approval and love you didn't get from your parents. It's now to grow up and heal past wounds!!! So if you suspect you are a people pleaser continue reading.
. you are always pretending. Pretending to agree with someone. Pretending to fit in. Pretending to like someone. Pretending you are not upset.
. you don't do anything out of the ordinary bcus Heaven forbid! What if you offend someone with your individuality??
. You are always "" happy"" to help someone. Even when you aren't. 
. you don't stand up for yourself or voice your opinion.
. you can't say no. You don't want to ""hurt"" someone's feelings.
. You save the day for everyone. But when you are in trouble  where are your friends? They are living their lives. They are not people pleasers like you!
So Dear people pleasers this is not kindness. This not being a ""good"" friend. This is manipulating people to get love and approval. Get up and be yourself unapologetically. People can hate you or love you. That's their problem. Speak up. Don't let people disrespect you! Be a rebel. Think of how much you have lost already.

He’s changing. Maybe this is who he truly is and I’m just starting to get a glimpse. It’s not all bad though. But one minute we’re all over each other the next we’re at each others necks. I used to take all the blame. Even when I don’t believe that what I’ve done was wrong, I considered the fact that I made him sad to be wrong. But then I realized that it has started to be a trend. That we’d fight and I’d end up apologizing. So I stopped. I stopped taking the blame and pleading my case. He’d do me wrong and be the one to act hurt. And he’s pretty damn good at it. Playing the victim I mean. I know what y’all thinking. Why don’t I leav e him? As cheesy and cliched this may sound, I love him. ‍
I used to judge girls for staying with men who disrespected them but hell, we can’t control our hearts. Damn thing does what ever the hell it wants. Don’t get me wrong, like I said it’s not all bad. I’m sure he loves me a lot and he’s protective and sweet. But all that goes down the drains when he shows me that he’s never trusted me and breaks his promises.

The nightmare is pretending that I don't care bout being so EMPTY even though these drugs got me mixing love and hate, it's all numb when it fades.  I am doing these to my self I whine about it till I get one hit then I remember why I do it. You can't complain bout the pain if it's self inflicted. You said you like me sober but I was never sober around you couldn't even see the difference. I bet she wants to tell me to stop but deep down she like it more when am on drugs. Pray she says how can I kneel and pray when I am never sober would God even listen to a drunk stoner like me. Never mind, I am all comfy here in the Hell I made just for me. I don't wanna go to heaven if all my friends aren't there.

Complaints....

Just as chuck Lorre ones said in his daily production rants, ""complaining is my birth right!""

And so it begins,
1. I keep secretly drinking alcohol for no reason what so ever.
2. My friend seems to be upset with me for a reason I have yet to figure out.
3. I've been getting more and more distant with my best friends.
4. Slacking off badly at school.
5. Becoming a constant headache to parents.
6. Have no care for other people's feeling what so ever.
7. Suicides happening around me. Don't twist my words, I don't want to do it. Honestly I think it's stupid and cowardice. Aaaand I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get a mouthful about what I just said.
8. Doesn't seem to figure out if me is rly me or is it all faking 
9. Am I person who talks behind people's back? If so fuck me 
10. I got nothing else I just thought it would seem cool if there was 10 complaints. 


So feel free to stab away with your insults and heal away with your kind words. Either way there's a high chance I might not feel any difference.

Alrighty, time for some whining. 

Now it has been quite a while since I last met a person who answers happily and honestly when asked how he or she is doing. All everyone keeps answering is 'I'm fine' or 'not bad'.
I miss the days when humans used to be exited for things. 
Don't go insulting me saying hypocrite or naïve. 

My fellow humans, I myself reply with a slight shoulder shrug and say ""mehh, I'm alright""
But I want to see other people being happy about their day, o want a hyper full on reply. 
Otherwise my shoulder shrugs r gonna turn into a frowning face and incessant whining.

Whats the point,
Why do i get out of bed to a world that doesnt feel,
But we can feel, we can all feel iy, or can we?
maybe u can but not everyone is so lucky,
Some of us only know what pain feels like,
The feeling of pain you get when somebody sticks a knife through you,
Or better yet 10.
But u dont see it bc. Its on the inside,
Its a constant darkness inside like your mom or dad or sister or brother or cat or dog died.
But it doesnt go away,
IT CANT GO AWAY

yeah sure im fine

im just some little kids entertainment 
On/off on/off

Really looked at them.
They may all just look like random lines amd scars to u but to me, they say help
do u remember that day when i told u i was sick,
U didnt ask why, maybe it was better that way but when u got homevu didnt say a word ti me i think we both knew why.
I was alone almost through it all, i tried to kill myself.
I wanted to,
But smtn or someone inside me said dont,
I dont want u to feel sry for me,
I dont want this, this thing to define me,
Bc. I have to feel  sry for myself for too long,
Am i better?
NO

NO
butvlet me tlk u through 
Let me show u wts in my head
Life is too short of a time to keeo u locked out

Lets say you get F in ever classes next time if your found on side way its not because of the F its because your idea your passion you limited those. Search all the successful people they are successful because there passion is brighter than there fear. And those fear limits you. And above all if your a girl there is more to you than you think. Stop dreaming of a perfect guy and dream of a prefect you. ""Lebamen set man yagegnatal"" says the bible R u that? Focus on you dnt limit yourself with the idea of only love.

Okay this is not exactly a vent but it has to  be addressed.
Why are we, girls, losing touch with ourselves in order to impress the world?? Especially men! Now don't get me wrong I don't have anything against guys. I have seen girls killing them selves to get attention even if it's outside their comfort zone. Why can't a girl go out and drink beer with her friends with out being pointed out on or bring perceived as a hoe. Why do we expect men to take care of us, to pay our bills and such. I am so fucking sick of this way of living. Forget the relationships, why are women doing all the small jobs? Why does a woman have to be good looking or flirtatious to get hired? We need to support each other and not fight over some dude. All girls care about is dressing up and putting make up on, go out clubbing, fuck some rich dude get every guys attention and in some case get hitched. Even the society suck balls! Everytime they see a woman of certain  age all they talk about is ""ohh she hasn't married yet"" why the fuck does it have to be like that. 99% of women waste their money buying make ups and wigs to make them look more appealing.

Not long ago i had a friend who committed suicide a month back. She was so bright. I swear to you she had the most amazing smile. Her genuineness was just beautiful. She was smart not just book smart but smart smart. Anywho i wasn't told about her death because I'm a cry baby and i get mad depressed when i go to funerals. But i should've. I hate myself for not seeing her struggle or for not checking up on her sooner. She just did it. I don't even know why but since then i wasn't right. My thougts on suicide is different.

A user manual to me
if we ever meet
I'm going to overwhelm you at first so don't be scared, i talk a lot when i find you attractive. I'll have so much energy for life it will either energise you or irritate the shit out of you.
I'm the worst planner but I make it up by being spontaneous. I'm the king of romantic gestures but don't get mad when i forget your birthday( I'll do that a lot)
our times together will be filled with great conversation about the big things in life and laughter but i need you to dig deep because i can sometimes use intellectual conversations as an exuse not to talk about my emotions.
My happiness is contagious but  my sadness is maddeningly confusing so you'll have to bare with me. i hope you're good with money cuz i spend it like a trust fund brat.
I'm romantic but i get distant when you don't return my affections. 
I've a great thirst for adventure so make sure you say your proper goodbyes to your bed and couch.
I'm preety chill with most things but i can't handle someone who needs others to be happy so go out find the happiness you seek before we meet.",optimism,POSITIVE,0.9873456358909607

I will bet most of you have asked this question at one time or another. I admit this isn’t the first time I’ve asked this question, but it’s the first time it couldn’t escape my mind. Hence I’ve decided to write about it and put these “impure” thoughts to rest. Some of you might argue “Oh she’s just craving meat and her mind is playing tricks on her” others might say ‘’It’s Satan!!” Trust me when I say, I’ve considered both. Anyway, why do people fast? What is the reason behind it? I’ve been raised by a truly religious mother and if I’m not incorrect, she told me we fast so we can deny the luxuries of life and get closer to God, remember all that he went through for our sins , pray, repent, and finally give back to the less privileged. This is of course the condensed version but I hope it sums it all up. Now I ask myself are these the reason I fast? Of course it is! At least that’s what I tell myself, but in reality it’s far from it. I fast because I’m selfish. I deny myself of some luxuries in life because I want to please God and do right by him and go to heaven. But if the true reason of fasting is to be completely selfless, what am I doing? I myself and most of my friends eat fish, carry impure thoughts, do the unspeakable, swear and gossip….and all the rest of it. Are we fasting? I doubt that.",curiosity,POSITIVE,0.8877608180046082

Hi everyone so my story is so long and its that I am a silent,shy n so kind person or so 'they' say n because of that i have so much things that i hide n bury inside me and doing that hurts and kills me from inside everytime. 
When ever I'm being fooled by 'them' I just smile n let it slide with just a fake warning or be silent about it like I dont know anythin about it I want to get revenge but i cant I just forgive 'them' without even tryin and ma frnds tell me I'm too soft n I need to be strict I just reply with ""i know n I will"" but I dont.
And I am very shy that I dont talk to girls to the part that I didnt talk to the girls in ma class like the whole high school until after going to the university I wanted to start a new life because I was in a new country n new faces n started talking to girls in ma class to be exactly responding to them
Recently I started to notice 1 of ma frnds (girl) who I thought of her as a normal frnd is talking with or about me with kindness n love or so I think n everytime she talks with me she talks nice about me and I automatically got to super shy mode and just responded with a big smile n 1 or 2 words like (thanks n u too)
N I thought in ma self maybe she likes me because I didn't express somethin like this before in ma life n because of this idea I started to notice her much more n started to have some feeling for her like I already had it from the beginning n day by day that feeling developed to love but kept silent about it as usual and buried it inside me but 1 day someone from her classmate confessed his feeling to her by a message and she was shy about it because it was the first time for her and thought she will ignore him because she didn't talk with him before but I think she accepted it going with the flow to get a bf because all of her frnds got bf and after a few days her frnds was talking about her n him being together the night I knew and the night I felt that wierd feeling the feeling of being stabbed in the heart and what I buried inside me got out for the first time I couldn't bury it I kept smiling with a pain in ma heart I never felt before but she never stopped talking with me like before even she spends more time with me than him so I wanted to try harder but what the difference I can't confess I dont have the courage or know how to do it. But I cant even sleep of thinking of her plus she still has that so called ""bf"" and I don't want her to be disturbed by me I wish her to be happy even if it is without me thats y I'm afraid to confess n if she replied with that painful ""I see u as a brother"" thing.
So it may be awkward for her at that time n I dont want her to be at that kind of place because of me. Sometimes I think y dont bury it inside me like I used to do n continue. So what to do about the kindness n silences problems should I do Somethin to change it and about ma crush what should I do again I'm sorry for the long story",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9810811877250671

Just a but recently one of our country's respected  artists was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease...and I hope he gets well soon I really do. About 60 people signed up as donors and made me realize one thing. How many of us would do that for the people in the hospitals whore dying slow and painful deaths? How many of us would give a penny to someone on a street? How many of us donate just some money for people in need of it? How many of us lend our kidneys to some stranger? What about those without money, fame or even family? Shouldn't we think of them too?

He has never really been mean to me but he made and still makes my mom cry almost every day. He cheats on her he even looked at a waitress and signaled her while i was sitting ryt there with my little brother he even threatened to kill her with a knife. Growing up i have seen so much worse and i forgave him and forgave him as she said she wld get a divorce now then after a month then anothet month. So last break i came home i actually ended up defending her and he got mad said a lot of things even hit me. Soo i have had enough and this break i decided not to go home and now the whole other family is asking nooo demanding i do. I don't wanna disappoint my family but seeing him now will worsen the remorse i have been building up for 20 years(not intended) i feel like i was going to explode and no one iss understanding me so i decided to come to you guys.

I hate her. I despise her. I look down on who she is and everything she stands for. In my eyes she is everything i dont ever want to become. If theres even the slightest chance that i'll become someone like her then i promise to live alone and isolated from people. Because i know i will make them as miserable and as sad and as bitter as she made me. Every second i spend with her makes me realise what an unhelpful, dumb, arrogant and hateful woman she truly is. She tries so hard to cover it up in front of other yet i still see through her fake smiles and bad jokes and make up. First chance i get, im going as far away as i can from her. To a place where i dont have to be reminded of that pathetic excuse of a woman. I'll forget her and live my life right. Be a better person than she was and will ever be.

Hey guys... this is for my friend. So she’s been friends with this guy she is madly in love with. I’ve never seen her like that, ever.  They know each other physically and when they go to ‘betekrestyan’ they see each other but never say hi. They only text and call. She told me it was because people will talk stuff (you know habesha old people) and so it’s very awkward especially considering the fact that he is not the type to talk to girls and he’s very different from the rest of his friends. Now she went to a different country and she still doesn’t know if he likes her or not... she confessed her feelings to him and he maskeyesed it but still kept on talking to her. He is quite a gentleman, he doesn’t flirt or ask her to do nasty stuff for him..... which makes it hard to think he’s a player... he is quite shy when he talks on the phone... she really needs my help but I’m as confused ‍ as her so I need yall’s help.

I remember the first day we’ve met it was back in high school, we just happened to sit around each other, I don’t usually start conversation with females but I did that day, the teacher didn’t show up and  we had a lot of time to talk, I recall our first conversation it was about a movie, this movie which we both had a fondness for so we talked for a while about the movie and then the bell chime out and you had to go,
I sat there with my friends talking but the whole time I was just waiting till the bell rings but we didn’t talk again because you didn’t show up for the next class, 
regardless of that I really was happy that day I remember Imaging this crazy scenarios on my way home, I always do that but this time you was in it.  
You see after that day you become my muse sometimes we talked and when we didn’t I looked at you silently, 
I liked looking at you when you are not paying attention because that’s when you’re beautiful the most because you’re not trying you’re being you and to me that was best version of you, 
and it felt good talking to you too, even discussing the little-little things around us with you felt good.
I hardly believe in prayers but I just kept praying for us to end up together, every night since i mate you I prayed.  
And I just kept imagining these scenarios in my mind of how we end up together and get married have kids and then grow old together, because they made me happy and they still do.  
Those were good times my best friend but I lost you on the way I still don’t understand how but you’re not mine, you were never mine. 
You are my best friend and the love of my life I know that but we were never meant to be together, so today I prayed, I prayed that the lucky guy who gets to be your husband knows your worth and make you happy always.

Am 21 ... first time venting 
It was last year that my life got into ups and downs . I met him when I was in grade 11 and I still remember how we met as if it was yesterday. He asked me out because of how beautiful I looked ( atleast that's what he said) but then I told him if he wants friendship that I'll be there with him then he accepted and we became friends (eventhough i knew he had feelings for me) and we even used to walk to school together(different school) then on his birthday I gave him this cute quote frame which says something about friendship then he got mad and sth... then we stopped meeting and staff . We moved on with our life but this day when I was in Campus after like 2 years : he called me out of no where (it was his birthday and we talked a lot and after a bunch of days and talking on the phone's , he asked me out again , to try things out and he promised that he wont hurt me in anyway and that he would always be their for me . So we started our journey ) and ya'ol people know how lonely you feel when you are out of your country and got no one to look after your crying ass. Becha we started talking and I started falling for him . This might sound cheesy  but He got me so hard . I wanted to come to Addis and learn coz that campus sucked the life out of me . So i told him and He wanted me to spend a night at his home right when I get back ,I was afraid to say yes but then he laughed at me and promised that he wouldn't touch me so I did and it was the best night ever ,with all the candles and Red Wine : it was romantic like in the movies and amazing...I never knew that I could love some one like that easily , I mean it was our first time seeing each other in years. With him : I felt as if the whole world didn't matter as if he was the only living I care about .. I wasn't my self, i was gone faraway from me . I didn't know what got into me when I see it now . If he wanted anything, I would give him . Haven't i mentioned that i live alone from when i was 12 years of age with the temelalash maid ofcourse (long story short: My dad pays for everything and He ain't in the country) . We spent most of our nights together , he got keys and he spends 4 days out of the week with me .He was my first Every thing. We had good times and bad times foremost. So one day he asked me to go abroad to study with him then we thought of how many good times we will spend mnamn . Keza he started the process and I didn't because my dad already started a process for me. Nevertheless tesakalet .  hede. I broke up with him because we both knew how long distances work and we finished it all on the phone . He came home the other day , kissed me and he was gone... that was it . I never talked to him or saw him either . My dad took me (i got no one to talk to now , u know the drill .. )and i think i'll never see him again, am afraid that I will never fall for any one . I still miss him . I always stalk him on social media's  and am afraid if I text him , that he won't answer . I don't even c a future . End of story. Uff

A lot of people ask me what my biggest fear is or what scares me most. And I know they expect an answer like heights or closed Spaces. or people dressed like animals, but how do I tell them that when i was 17 I learned things about relationships, i learned that most people fell out of love for the same reasons they fell in it. That their lover's once endearing stubbornness has now become refusal to compromise, and their one track mind is now immaturity, and their bad habits that you once adored is now money down the drain, their spontaneity becomes reckless and irresponsible and their feet up on your dash is no longer sexy just another distraction in your busy life.

I'm not sure what this is exactly so bear with me. I'm in medical school. I hate it which doesn't surprise me much. When I was a kid my father used to make me read, he made me read magazines, short stories, novellas most in Amharic but he wanted me to be able to speak English too so whenever he travelled he brought me an 'improve your English' or 'learn American English' CDs and tapes. He made me listen to them memorize them even when I protested. God I must have had 20 of those tapes, he made me listen to every fucking one . He made me write poems and memorize them, recite them learn them by heart. And I grew to love them. I loved the poetry, the analysis, the essays. Writing became an out let.
I have two other siblings, both older than me. Now them... my father them do 10 math questions each day. They couldn't skip a single day, not one. Now my brother is a mechanical engineer and my sister is a physicist working on her masters. 
And me I am a medical student, because how the fuck am I supposed to support myself on a writers pay. I told my brother I wanted to learn literature once, the disgust on he face was saddening if not amusing. He's an egocentric douchbag that thinks every other career other than engineering and medicine is beneath him, but I love him all the same. 
Anyway I guess it just hit me exactly how much our parents affect us. I want to be a writer because I've been reading since I was 5. My siblings are engineers and physicists because my dad would take them to construction sites, make them help until they grew to enjoy it.

Ok here goes my vent, so one day i was travelling with my family and we had to take brakes at places to enjoy them,and at one place we got to a place where we had long relatives so we decided to stay there for a while before we went home, the area was nice too so we would agreed it was better to rent a house per day,  and the very next day we got in to that house i saw this cute boy(not good looking)but cuteee, and i just kept my cool and just sat in front of our door and his house was sort of infront of ours so, i wasnt trying to look at him(obviously not). but then he started making funny faces to make me lough,which made me blush, then i just sat there like a fool making faces to make him lough too,  we just sat there for like an hour glancing back and forth at each other(couldnt keep my eyes away from him ) and since then for about,  2 weeks i just sit outside at the exact time and so will he and we just flirt through our eyes, and he always made me blush and one Day he just dissaoeared for like a month (ps we stayed in that house for 2 month cause i couldnt leave without seeing him again) and finally my family convinced me by saying there we could come to this place again(like i cared about the house), so i agreed to leave. And one day when it was 2 days before our leaving day, he came back..... he was here, he saw me and i swear i can tell he missed me too, i was about to talk to him but i was scared, and he was gonna say hi but i was with my family so he just stood there but still staring at me, so i thought ill talk to him tomorow but little did i know, my dad arranged for us to leave one Day earlier.......i felt a big pain in my chest, dont know why........ we left next thing in the morning and our home was extremly far, i cried for two days cause i was such a cowerd i didnt talk to him......... and it has been 8 month since i saw him,  and every time i meet new Boys or go on A date or even sleep with them,  i end up thinking of him and wonder if he even still remembers me, or if he reads this vent and get the thought maybe i wrote it........ i dont know what this is but if i feel this much for a guy i dont know,  then i believe true love may exist",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9954903721809387

Hello. I guess I'll be partly venting, tell you my opinion and ask a question.
So I'm a girl. And I don't have a boyfriend. But I don't want to end my teens with out having sex. Mind you, I don't think sex before marriage is for me because I don't want the whole spouse and family stuff. I'm not aimless in life. Of course I want to fall in love sometime but I don't want his love be declared to me as a marriage proposal.
Anyway, my question is what should a first time be like? Should it be with someone you know(but isn't your bf)? Or should it be a total stranger you met at the club? Because I really don't want to regret something I don't even care about(my V card). But emotions are bound to get high after the 'first time' regardless.

I was thinking many things that I didn't know where he was taking me. when I was out of my thought I saw he was taking me on a different path from our usual. I asked him where we were going and he said “ere feta bey, we are just going to chill” I was shocked cause the meaning of chill for him is going to club and drinking his stomach out. even if i like him more than a friend i don't want to let that happen. if two hormonal teenagers drink alone it is not a secret that they would do sth they will regret for life.I wanted to say no but I couldn't so I show him that specific face that I show when I don't want to agree. he looked at me longer that I start sweating. there was literally a rain from my hand. I can see he was sad but at the same he wanted to dare sth. I told him to take me back to school, he took me back, he left me there and went alone. I kind of knew his intention but I never thought he would do this to me, to his friend. what shall I do? I really don't know what to do? does avoiding will solve everything? or confront him?

I don't know how to write this
U were in my heart for a Lotta years 
I swear every Lil moment was bliss
I just wanna show u how it feels 
I recall the first day I saw you
I wonder what they might call you
Didn't know ur name, ur face was the beauty who puts others to shame 
Day,weeks,months pass 
Till I saw u in my class 
It was on a thermo test
I sat behind u running late
Didn't know what do, so I committed a theft
I tried my best 
But there was no time left
That's when I knew ur name 
That got stuck in my brain
That day I learnt ur beauty was ur brain
Ohhh shit I really don't know what to do 
I sit down and can't stop thinking of u
With this all memories of you
No matter how hard I try
Couldn't forget the time when I saw u cry
U were sick in the class 
I think it was on maths
That u couldn't take it anymore
U left the class that was on the 2nd floor
I saw you through the door
While u crying sitting on the floor
Another year passed 
Tho I didn't stop living in the past
But the day came that I wished it would last
U get to know my name
Since then , I have never felt the same
Some times I wonder why I have these memories
Just to be a lonely one side to the story
I just feel like I had to write this as vent 
Although it ain't no best ,I just get it off of my chest
My feelings were like a silent volcano 
Now it turned to swerving tornado
The feeling I had for you? U will never know
Its only me and my echo
But u don't feels the same that's okay tho",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9929628968238831

Ok i just read a vent about a girl who might be in love with a guy she just had a few eye contacts with and if thats true,then let me tell u my story
Am a girl in grade 11 now,and i have learned in my school for about 8 years. So i know most of the students at least their face, and one day i saw this boy, i dont how i havent seen this boy before or maybe i just didnt notice but all i knew was this was our first eye contact, and it was cool then but from our first eye contact we started seeing each other extremly more in school, i even started recognizing his voice, and this things became more rapid that i started looking for him,going to the cafe or i.T lab just to see if he was there and after that i started thinking about him when i go to home.....and if i see him going down the stairs i start to make execuses to go down too,even if i was going up......our eye contacts got more harder, i can tell he looks for me too cause i'll sometimes catch him staring at me during national anthem and we were in d/t grades he was one year above me.......and with out speeking one word to eachother a whole year passed and same thing started next year as well.....i started developing feelings for him,what was onec a simple crush started to take my brain the whole day, he was in my thoughts and i tried to get him of my mind by saying ""he is not cute,he is not that tall and he doesnt dress well"",but girls u know this doesnt work once u liked a boy......and this year i couldnt handle it so i thought i wont look at him at all but that went for about 2 weeks till i started thinking of him again, we stoped looking at eachother or atleast i stoped but i still thought of him and this year was over too and during the last test of the year i decided to meet him and i did, i walked up to him and i introduced my self and i knew his name for a year now but acted like i didnt know anything about him but he was cool,so i saide goodbye and went home but after that we all came many times to school likefor a week for things like recieving our test then for a correction then for transcript and for things like that and every time he was there and all the times he avoided me,am not lying i mean it he fucking avoided me, he wouldnt even smile when i smile at him he just looks away.......and after those days i got back to school agiain i became 11 but he didnt continue 12 grade here, he changed school......and i've never seen him again........so i wanted to ask u guys if its possible to fall for someone u didnt know,and is it bad pretending someone u dont know their  name,cause i think he was avoiding me for that.....any ways i just wrote this to tell that girl u are not alone,i fell for a guy that i didnt knew either",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9976108074188232

Just because I look strong doesn’t mean I don’t break. Just because the only emotion I seem to act out is anger doesn’t mean I don’t hurt. Just because I hide my feelings doesn’t mean I don’t feel. And I regret what happened. I really do. You keep telling me it will be fine eventually, while how you act just tells me that I have lost you. I was once your “Hope” but now I am the official source of your pain, the reason behind your choice to go back to old ways. And I can’t say anything to change it, I can’t do anything to fix it because what I have to say doesn’t matter. What I think isn’t your concern because I don’t matter anymore. And you asked why my voice sounded different and if I was sick. Truth is all I am doing right now is crying rivers over what used to be. I know I said I would die before I cry over you but I can’t help it. And it doesn’t seem to stop. Even the shower isn’t strong enough to hide it.

This past week i tried being cold so he'd stop (just 1 text a day, or yes or no replies) but suddenly he got sensitive almost like he's feelings were hurt, so I acted like my normal self & at the end of the convo he was like please don't be like that again.

Lost in my own damn mind
Fuck I lost it all 
Don't even know what goes on up there 
It maybe building a wall 
A wall so high and thick ready to cover it all
But soon to be broken
It wasn't meant to stay long 
I wasn't meant to stay long 
I am staring a book infront of me 
Not knowing what to do even tho we all know what to do
I can't focus can't concentrate 
Can't see the bigger picture 
Forgot how to live and I don't need no lecture 
Searching for ways to make it go away
I found a few but risk people asking question 
And i can't lie its just not in my nature 
But it kills me even more talking like its common culture 
I wish it doesn't have to end

/ i type everything in lower case and i tend not to use apostrophes because im always in a hurry but i swear i know  grammar/

this is stupid and dramatic but a couple of classmates this morning kept telling me i was ugly and that the way i walk (i walk with my back hunched i guess) makes me look even worse. i mean they were being kinda rude about it. they used this expression there's in italian (my native language) which means ""you look like a toilet"" and it's pretty rude. also theyre both the ""brutally honest"" kind of people so no, they werent doing that just because bullying is fun or theyre envious. they meant it.

and i just cant stop thinking about it cause ive always been very self conscious about how i look and i put on tons and tons and tons of foundation and concealers to make it better and i take care of my brows as best as i can, and i take care of my skin which luckily isnt that bad as i get like one pimple once every blue moon. but thats really the only thing that doesnt suck about me. im so pale you can see my veins, im not skinny, im not tall. people pick on me because i walk fast and with a hunch.

its just exhausting.

i just wish they hadnt told me. cause really. i know im ugly. but if others tell me i cant pretend im ""not that bad"".

i know being ugly isnt the worst thing that could ever happen to someone. i know. i know this is fucking stupid. but i just care so so so so so much about what others have to say. and when its something bad like this its just the most awful thing ever. i havent been able to focus all day but i dont wanna talk or cry about it because im aware of how stupid and pathetic this is.

i wish i were actually worth something, like, ""hey, that person's ugly, but holy shit they're so smart!"" or whatever, getting good grades would be enough. but no. im ugly. im stupid. i get awful grades. im absolutely fucking terrible at sports. i have no talents except drawing which is the thing im best at doing AND IM NOT EVEN THAT GOOD AT IT. im really really average-skilled. maybe even below average, really. to someone who doesnt have a clue about drawing, my stuff might look ""gorgeous"" and ""amazing"" but... i, as the one who drew it, can tell its not. its not, i can see the mistakes screaming at me. i can see the smudges. i can see the wonkier lines. i can see the exaggerated shading. i can see everything and i wish i didnt. i wish i didnt know. 

and the fact that the only people that got crushes on me were TWO (2) people that dont know me irl and that i met on the internet says something about me.  im just that ugly. you cant fall for me if you can see my face first. also im pretty sure one of those two people was lying about thinking i was pretty when they saw my pics. 

ive only have had one relationship and it was a long distance one and i still cant believe to this day i had the FUCKING nerve to be the one who breaks up with the other. because, fuck, how the hell am i going to find someone else? okay, it would have been hella unfair to the girl i was with because she deserved better, but it was so nice to feel loved, even if it was a long distance thing. i cant believe i threw that away.

ill probably get over this but i needed to get it out of my chest.

Its going to be very long but please i need help so read.
Its not actually a confessio, i jst want an advice. Dont judge.
Ok im a grade 12 student a girl and i have a boyfriend whom i know for a very  long time, since we were little and it has been 2years since we have been together. I love him so much, he is everything to me and life without him would be impposible to imagine. You could probably say your a student just focus on your studies blah blah... but eventhough we aren't matured enough yet we cant control whom to love and when it just happens so try understanding. So the thing is i dont trust him like none none... i always make myself belive that he is just lying to me like even the little things i dnt belive him.. like if i ask him what he is doing and if he tells me he is just taking a nap i dont believe him. And it sucks u have no idea. He always tell me to trust him but smtg inside of me just keeps me from believing him.  We fight many times just because of the trust and i tell him that i will try but i cant and he knows i cant too. We learn in the same school and so most of the timr i see him and i get so angry when i see him talking to other girls like even if he is with his fellas there is this one girl that likes him and i know for sure so if she hangs out with them i get so upset if he is there. I told him that i didnt like her so i dont want to see him with her after i saw him holding her. What makes me more angry is he was holding her hand so close her chilling, his friends were with him and as soon as heard my voice betam denegete keza lekekat. Ena beka if im talking to him on social medias and if i see her be online i jst get upset cause i get the idea he is chatting wid her n me at the sametime so my mood changes suddenly. The other thing is after chatting with him i sleep then if im awake at the middle of de night like around 7 seat mmamn they are both online keza i ask him what he is doing and he says he cant sleep. 
And mostly he hangs out with his frnds but if i suddenly found out he is out alone. I get the thought that he is with her plus demo she likes to drink, smoke, makeout blah blah.... and im totally opposite of her. I dont drink like none at all and i dont smoke, i even hate when i see peoples smoke and im not a ""makeout"" kinda person i even kiss my bf like once or twice a month. I dont have a proof between two of them but i just fear he could love her and leave me because she could give him things that i cant and am scared of that.
So anyway peoples help me out please. Why dont i trust my bf? Why do i always imagine him and her? How can i start trusting him?",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.995760977268219

Hey guys so here is what is happening 

I have this normal female friend and we met at campus we say we are best friends but we hardly call or text each other on a regular basis she has been through a lot and every guy she met is been after her for a sexual relation but in our relationship I just wanted to be friends but I am always the one with the first step the only time she talks sensitive is when I am sick. Sometimes I feel like she says she misses me because I said I miss her first and the other day she told me she was depressed and I wanted to help. I had a family problem and I came back home (2 month ago) and guess what I called her after a month and a half since we last spoke and she said she would talk to me later

So is this for me to feel like this naturally? Is it wrong for me to be approached once in a while? And girls would you avoid or take a guy friend for granted like this if you really cared for him? I need your advises please

At this point I just feel like there's no real reason for me to live on. I mean, what's the point of going through all this pain, knowing it won't pay off? People keep telling me that it gets better. But y'know, they told me that two and three years ago too, and no, it didn't get better at all. In fact, it got worse. More responsibilities. More fake people to deal with. More emotions to bottle up. And I'm only in high school. I just don't want to go through any of this anymore. The main reason I don't off myself is that I don't know how. Every method has a terribly crucial flaw. And I keep thinking of my parents, and some of my friends too. About how bad they would feel. They'd probably be freed of many responsibilities, especially my parents, but I know they love me. They'd be completely destroyed. So what I must do is keep going through this excruciating shit that I'm surrounded by and try to make my pain go unnoticed. For other people I don't even care all that much about in the first place. I know it's lame to say I don't  care about my parents. And I also know everyone suffers. I know it could be a lot worse. I know there are kids dying in Africa. But I'm weak. I don't want to do this anymore. There is no getting better. There's no happiness for me out there. There is nothing for me out there. Except disappointment and pain. It's just too much. I see how people hurt each other everyday and it kills me from the inside. I see how people hurt me, how they hurt themselves, it's too much.
This rant is probably just a side effect of sleep deprivation but I needed to talk about this stuff. I've had this toxic, nihilist and ""everyone and everything sucks"" mindset for years now. I should be used to it. But every time I meet someone new I get my hopes up and think they're better than all the people I've had to deal with in the past. I'm never right on that.

I didn’t want to think or write or even vent about this because if I do then it would mean that it really is something that’s bothering me. Childish, I know. 
So here goes. I never thought of myself as the jealous type. I mean I do get jealous but I don’t go crazy over my pointless jealousies and act on them or anything. Anyways, am I jealous of his ex? Yes. Am I jealous of the girl he used to talk to before we got together? Yes. Am I jealous of the girl everyone thought he was dating(he still has several pictures of her in his wallet btw, I didn’t even ask about it)? YES! But I know that’s all in the past and that I got the boy and that he chose me . These “jealousies” just indicate that I actually love and care about him, so they’re pretty easy to shrug off. All of that is to show you that I’m rational and I trust him with all my heart. 
We have a friend. I was friends with her first , so over the years I’ve seen how selfish she can get sometimes(hence why we’re not close).
I remember her trying to get his attention and everything back in the days but I just assumed she wanted him to be one of the guys she leads on but keep at arms length. Bicha after we started dating they became close friends. He even felt comfortable enough to tell me that he loves her so much. I just said “Yeah, she’s great.“
So one day we were in our dorms studying for an exam and I run out of credit so I asked if I could use her phone to send him a text. I did and just when I was about to give the phone back I saw my name. Call me weak or judge if you want I don’t care. I SCROLLED. 
We had a fight and he was talking to her about it. He even forwarded some of my messages to her . Guess what her solution to ALL our problems was? To see each other less. To create distance between us. Yes he listened to her and tried it. No I didn’t agree to it and we had another fight. 
I swear I try to turn a blind eye to the little things. She calls him for no reason and when he tells her he’s with me she asks stupid questions about class and hangs up. To answer your question, she has a weird on and off thing going  on with another guy. What pisses off me the most is I don’t think she even loves him like that. She makes it look like I’m not good enough for him. I guess she’s used to being the pretty girl everyone has a crush on . 
What gets to me even more is I never thought I would ever be this kind of person. It’s very exhausting and sad. I want to roll my eyes and ignore everything that’s going on but she’s everywhere.",approval,NEGATIVE,0.9697855114936829

I've  been abused sexually as a child. Now I'm an adult and can't trust anyone around me because my abuser spent years abusing me verbally, and keeps telling me it's part of my imagination and that I'm gay if I tell people about it. Strange part is that I forgive the abuse but not the denial. Because his denial hurts more than the trauma I'm still going through. I honestly can't get close to girls I like because Everytime I do I feel like I'm getting abused all over again. I dunno why.   I'm also angry at him because he still tries to tell people they should not believe what I say because it's mostly my imagination going wild. Even though I only confront him when he is alone. I can't fully hate him because he is still my big brother but why would a brother do this to his own blood? I don't like judging people but he is evil.

What is the point of it all, like really cause some people say it is to be as happy as possible but is the point of my life to release as much dopamine as i can into my brain... Others say its all abt god and/or watever spiritual story they believe in, but r u actually serious abt this, do u honestly think that wat u believe is true... Lets forget abt the fact that u r too dumb and emotional(we all are) to even comprehend wat is going on, even if u had had all the information u needed. But all u have to trust on is how it all makes u feel inside. Why do u even think u even have an inside, i mean arent we empty when u think abt it... U go from skin to flesh then to bone then a bit of flesh again and thats it, there is no such thing as a soul, interms of everything else we r no better than stone. In that case we have no free will or conscience, we just think we do... But do we even exist, i am not saying do we exist as matter but do we exist as entities and beings cause i see no reason for as to believe that unless we want to see ourselves as special and accumulate even more hormones to make as feel even better abt ourselves.

So I've been dating this amazing guy he's super goofy ,sweet and very loving but its only when it comes to me . He's  normally the very shy type  he doesn't talk much he's the guy who's distant but mysterious. It amazes me how we got together am the fun and outgoing type. So lets cut to the chase he is not the romantic type and he thinks he's not good enough for me  but i know he loves me and i love him too he fears i will fall out  but the more he gets distant the worse it gets.

i cried like a baby yesterday night
called up mom and cried

Got rejected by my crush, 3rd time I got rejected. I'm 23, never been in a relationship 

A lot has happened over the past two weeks, got my heart broken, health going worser day by day and probably am jobless right now

I haven't actually quit my job to be honest but the mental and physical state i'm in is making it tough to go back, in fact I don't wanna go back to work 

I want to avoid people, for good, stay alone, in my shell, grow my hair and facial hair long, maybe read religious books as they just might give me peace


The human brain is stupid, I just wish someone, at lease someone just came to me and said I was important to him/her and they loved me. Even if it was fake, I'd accept it and probably be over the moon

Every time I hold the guitar I kinda want to cry, I am having this very strange breakdown every time I think about myself

I'm not useless, I am educated, have or had a job, can play the guitar and can write decent, heck that puts me at least on the 95 percentile of all guys at least that's how I think

Yet it feels so darn depressing to be ignored and treated like a doormat by everyone. Girls think I'm invisible

only parents and family and close friends have cared and I'm thankful for that but if I look into the bigger picture, I'm just a grain of sand for the others and that has shattered me

I'm not angry at her, neither did I confess, the very fact that she can be so happy with someone just by singing to his guitar strums seems like the pure love or at least the perceived pure love that I think I will never be able to give to anyone. That too being the guy was from a different faith tells you a lot that nothing matters in love maybe, but marriage i guess yes but that's a whole different ball game whatsoever.

I'm hurt that she or any other person will probably never look at me with glimmering eyes,  and be genuinely happy to be with me. Heck even a fake show of happiness would probably mend my broken soul but that isn't gonna happen either


I so wanna lock up myself at home. Stay alone, read books, religious ones even, avoid contact to such an extent that I never develop feelings again. I really want to learn to live alone and be happy again",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9900880455970764

I used to think the world didn't give me anything, that I didn't owe anyone. I came naked from my mother womb and naked shall I return. in the little time of my stay all I was served was pain and ache, too sour for my little heart but was forced to gulp it down my throat. i struggled, I screamed, I cried and even pleaded. everyone is busy saving themselves that no one came for the rescue. i understand we all have our problems besides the dawn has passed and I have seen the light now (at least that's what I tell my self) I wouldnt change the things that has happened, they are both a blessing and a curse. but more than anything what's ironic is all our suffering is man made. I don't understand why its so easy to be bad than Good.  it beyond my comprehension but for me I know this: anyone capable of inflicting pain is someone who licks his wounds in private. so I don't blame anyone. someone started this journey somewhere and we have been cascading down this road ever since. now its a be better or be bitter dogma but why do many people choose bitter?  I am hopeful their will come a day where we wear our scars like an armor instead of trying to stain others with the same bruise cause our scars,  they are not ugly. they tell our story, who we are and what we have been through. till then I keep hoping cause though I don't owe anyone anything, this world has given me one thing: my name.

We perceive life as a bitter journey bc we have been trained all our lives to think that way, and to live that way.

As a result, we grow up thinking our happiness is not acceptable! Suffering suffering suffering. We build walls around us, walls in the name of culture and  religion. Like invisible tissues that connect us so we can be afraid tgtr we tie each other like a shakesprian plot so we can all be silently afraid tgtr. Our physical being wants bliss but our poisoned minds tell us that's wrong! No u can't dance in the rain u will look foolish and embarrass ur family, or u should be ashamed of sex and never discuss it.

I prefer to be anonymous but here is what I would like to confess. I have been looking for affection my whole life so I search for it everywhere I don't even set alotY of criteria to date a guy and the guy whom I have been with was in on and off relationship which I don't give that much attention since he clearly told me he is not relationship kind of guy so I accepted his idea....but recently things between us started to change and started to act as boyfriend but when I ask him what I mean to him he doesn't say anything then I tried to ignore him n dated another guy and suddenly there was strong sexual tension and end up having sex then the next day, the previous guy told me he is now ready to be my boyfriend and even introduced me to his friends as his girl,and that night I also have had sex with him which left me with guilty mind since I haven't been totally innocent as he was and feel like am cheap or something.

My anxiety feels like I'm in a dark room, pitch black and the floor falls from underneath me. I keep falling and I claw on the walls wanting to grip something. Eventually I find my footing only to find that it was temporary. There are a thousand 'what ifs' in my mind. What if I never get a good job? What if I can't make it? What if I'll never be happy? What if all my hard work was for nothing?

I lose my footing. I am falling again. I am screaming, yelling hoping someone listens but they don't. No one ever does. I am alone. No. Wait! I am not alone.

I wonder how people will act if they found out whatever they believe in is bullshit... Would they still do good things instead of bad, would they even be able to differentiate between the two, would gays still be oppressed, will they be content with a life that is meaningless... The thing is what you do because of your religion doesnt reflect who you are, what you would have done without it is what shows your true colours. My point is, be who you really are cause if God is there he will probably judge you according to that anyway, not by whatever façade you have been putting on.",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9990733861923218

Okay so I read a vent of few days back and commented there, but since my comment deserves it's own platform here i am... venting it. I am trying to make a point here.
Why the hell is everyone missing the bigger picture... ?!!!  Is that all you care about? Like the fact that he called her ""fat during sex""?!! (It was on one of the vents) True he shouldn't have said that but let me tell you something... nomatter how much most of you people hate to hear it... you shouldnt have had sex before marriage! But you did- okay- the damage is already done.. but just repent and just dont do it again til the time is right! Like i dont know why everyone is moving blindfolded in this matter!!! You guys should FREAKING WAKE UP!!! you think it makes you 'cooler' to do that? Its NOT! And you know what else is not cool? Hell! 
And if these people were married (in the eyes of God), he wouldn't have dared to disrespect her. If not for her sake he won't for his own belief's sake. Everytime unmarried people go around 'screwing eachother' guess what happens? The cycle of boredom b/n the 'mates' continues. So don't expect the outcome to change unless you change your cause for it. 
Thanks for those who read it and agree with me.. thanks for those who read it and don't give 2 shits &is probably thinking of what to insult me on this platform just so people could look and like your comments. I don't care! But I wrote all of this cause I do care enough about this sorta people, so I just hope some1 out there understand not everything that done on TV, or not everything people nowadays do to claim they are 'young' is right!

So I’m from a Christian family (Protestants) to be specific. I grew up learning about the Bible and stuff. Well I’m having a problem with the Bible now. Specially the Old Testament. That describes God as a monster, brutal and stubborn. And in the mean time that contradicts with it self.  Saying Don’t kill and praising those who committed genocide in the name of God...take David for eg he killed 22,000 Syrians and he is considered to be the bravest. However, I’m not saying bible doesn’t teach some good things but these things are not easy enough to let it pass. I still believe in God but I can’t really make the Bible as a manual for my life.

I had made freinds with the monsters. Learning there  language so well that I could use it for myself. Funny thing is I was accepted by most because of this anomaly. I was given a throne. But once I renounce the demons that I had once befriended I find my self normal yet completely outcasted from the kingdom  I once ruled. Why do we glorify the wrong but discard the right as though it means nothing? Have you ever asked you selves what we have normalized? I found out much later that it much too simple for man to raltinalize the abnormal than to accept the normal. It is much more easier  for us to find beauty in chaos than serenity in the order.

This isn't really a vent but my view on some of the vents i seen. Girls who lost their virginities for a guy they have been seeing for a month or two are stupid, honestly do you think if he really loved you he would put you in that position? Do you think he will stay with you after you have given him the one thing that makes you innocent. No he ain't, you spread your legs by the name of love and be surprised and all when he leaves you for a girl who has her dignity intact. This post is gonna get me alot of bad comments but seriously girls use your head, its your dignity he fucks, you shouldn't do that before marriage, koy do you think your future husband will respect you after that? No he won't, am not religious or anything but i do know guys respect virgin girls. Its a big deal to be with a girl who won't just spread her legs with every guy she dates.

Hey there...first time venting... got a lot of things to complain about just as much as we say we're okay; can't complain.

So I'm a jobless graduate who's very passionate about music and for some reasons I think only I understand don't not want to pursue any other thing before I start my music path. But that arrogant mind set has not put me in a good situation and I know it...it's going to be almost a year since graduation and I haven't done anything yet with my music. I currently leave outside of the city where I can not find anything musical to do or anyone in the industry that could be of help and not doing nothing in a town where you don't know anything as well is just a daily headache. On top of everything that's going on in my life which I'm not going to start about this one is the worst thing to add up to. I need help. I want to get my shot together in the city and pursue my dreams more than anything in the world right now. And I know I can make it big time.

Hello there.
So I have been seeing a lot of vents about virginity and stuff and honestly I would really want to say something.

Sex is a good thing , actually the BEST feeling ever. God created this so called SEX so that people can reproduce and replace themselves. Everything created by God is beautiful and well SEX is that too. Everything about it is so good. 
Now remember you do that precious thing that one amazing thing that God gave you with someone. That someone is going to see you naked , going to touch every part of you , every PRECIOUS part of you. Its not just about the pleasure , but all about love. Your bodies become ONE. See this is the main reason why I believe that sex should be after marriage because my body is not something I could play with , but something so beautiful and valuable. I AM WORTH IT. I have the dignity in myself that God brought me to this world to be with the one person I'm going to enjoy my whole life with , and that one person should be the only one I'm going to make LOVE to. 

P.S I really wish you could understand what I just wrote and make use of it. I'm an 18 year old girl and YES I might me younger than most of you , but I really hope this can help to brighten up your eyes.

I just have one simple point to prove about this 'sex being a GUY thing and NOT a GIRL thing' debate.
First of all..most guys are horny and crazy about sex and we know it buttt girls are just as nasty as us...U girls just don't show it like we guys do (u r better at hidding it). 
Guys portray their sexual desire freely but girls always act disgusted when they hear about those things (eventhough they might be thinking about it before the guy)

Remember to breathe 'cause it'll take your breath away,
When the engines cough's,
And you blast off.
Ignite the night with a firecracker flash.
Remember to live 'cause you're gonna be thrilled to death,
When the stars collide,
And your eyes grow wide.
Take it in with your face against the glass.
Remember to dream 'cause it's gonna be a starry night
Over every town
As you look down.
So harmonize with the singing satellites.
And remember to scream 'cause you're gonna be lost for words,
When the sparks erupt
And they light you up.
Let's hear it for the Universe
Where it never hurts
Diving in head in first.
Take a taste of the melting Milky Way.

I was outside waiting for the bus. Then when he asked me a question i answered in my supposedly squeaky voice,  which mind you is not squeaky at all. I promise but somehow for him it is.

Hello guys. Don't know how to start so let's me just jump right to it.
Sometimes I hear people telling me things are a sin and I just want to call out bullshit. I mean, from the teachings I got from church, it doesn't seem like something God should care about. And then they say it's in the bible. Fine, sure it's in the bible, but do you understand that this isn't the original scripture from God? They're all interpretations within interpretations. People read something and decide what this really means instead of being accurate as possible. What I'm trying to say is that, what we're learning and quoting, might be vastly different from what was actually said. And I don't know if this is me believing that people are full of utter BS or if this is me being too unfaithful and blasphemous and being too lazy to follow the rules. 
For example, the whole ""Wife is to follow all her husband's orders."" I'm sorry, but if a husband tells his wife to kill someone, is she supposed to follow that too?
And being judgmental. Yes, being gay is wrong, yes, sex before marriage is wrong, but didn't God say that it was not our place to judge people? So why the discrimination and the hateful words? They're still people. People who did nothing to you and people your abusing and that is still wrong. Your punishing a sinner (which again, not your place) by being a sinner yourself? Good luck with that.
And also, women needing to cover up from head to toe. I'm pretty sure that was placed there to not ""tempt"" men, but if they're supposed to respect the bible, why should wearing anything a girl wants be a problem? Men are just saying they're to weak and zero will power. And there are many more of these kinds of stuff.
But through all this, I still don't know if it's my interpretation of things or just how the world should run. I can't exactly say anything about this now can I? But I believe that if we're good people and respect each other, that's what God really wants, right? Being peaceful, being full of love instead of hate, don't be evil, and things like that?

I love them but sometimes I just feel like an outsider, like am just an unnecessary burden to people around me and like they only keep me around because they have no choice. I hate feeling like this. Am not a loner am a very socially active person who is happy a lot but when I get sad it goes so far that I don't even realize how bad it is until am thinking of ways to die.. I hate that, I don't want to be that and I hate that most of my tears are caused by my family and that they make me wish I was dead.

My thoughts are so ridiculous that I can't even voice it to anyone I know. You see, everything's going great for me. I'm getting everything I've ever wanted. Everything that I've been working on for years is yielding results and yet... I can't shake off this hollow feeling deep in my gut. I keep thinking that everything is about to start crashing and it's about to happen real soon. I've been dealing with depression for years, and I've always been able to pin a reason for at least some of it: ""it's because this is happening, or that isn't."" It's always been something that I can grasp and work on changing. And now that I've done pretty much everything I can and have to an extent succeeded. I just have to wait a little till I can actually grasp it in my hands though. I have everything and yet the depression is still fucking here. This numb hollowed out feeling and the suicidal thoughts are still fucking here. None of this makes sense. What more am I supposed to do? Am I meant to be eternally fucked up? Do I not deserve some happiness after all of it? It's exhausting. And I'm getting tired of pretending I'm ok.

This isn’t a vent. This is a man telling the boys in this group what it means to be a man. Read this when you’re ready to grow up.

Respect yourself for fucks sake. Don’t beg for anything. You’re a man. You want something, go and fucking get it for yourself. Don’t smoke. What the fuck is your problem? This is your temple. This is your one gift from God and you’re filling it with hookah smoke and weed? 
Respect every woman. Did you just call a woman a bitch, oh you called her a hoe? Shut the fuck up. She’s not your slave. She’s not yours to control in any way. She is as powerful as you are in every way. You can fuck every girl in town and be a legend, but she can’t? It’s her life. If you dare call the beauty that is the female anything other than fucking godly, kill yourself.

Respect your goals. Have discipline for fucks sake. You said you’d do it? Fucking do it. What the fuck are you waiting for? The fact that you’re not where you want to be in life should be motivation enough. And discipline is so much more attractive than your bullshit tattoos and Snapchat selfies.

So this one is for the guys to answer. Let's say u have a thing going on with a girl. Have u ever gotten close.... maybe too close with her girlfriends? Don't u think it's kinda weird?
I mean this isn't a one time thing. Let's say one of my girlfriends is involved with a guy. But then I see him drift to another one of the girls in the group and they get so close that it's hurting the first girl. Guys, why DO u do it?? Please be honest, especially those who've found themselves in the same dilemma. 
I was the one getting hurt. But then about a year later i found my self being the girl hurting my friend slezi I told her guy who also happens to be a great friend of the whole group and ALSO who's going to be in my class for the next year to basically go screw himself, & we've been ignoring each other for the past two weeks. No one has noticed yet but when they do its going to be really awkward. I can't tell her it's cuz I didn't want to be that girl who might be flirting with her boyfriend but there was no other way to get him off my back. It sucks he was a great friend, why'd he have to go ahead and try to sweet talk his girlfriend's best friend?

So this is l. Last time I vented about all your ideas being stupid.I have some opinion to state.  So what i want to say is every opinion we have is relative. As long as it comes from us and our experiance, it's relative. Their is nothing exact or truth to it( if its truth then it's our truth, it might not be somebody else's truth). As humans when we do some action, that action can get reinforced or be followed by a punishment so we don't repeat that behaviour. So it depends on our society,our environment And ourselves  to determine the outcome‍‍( mind u! That is not an excuse to blame those things, since eventually we do have brain).So why are we judging and conceding ourselves? Why?. Tomorrow we might end up in the same situation as the people we laughed at.who knows rt? Nobody can tell the future‍! So why do we judge and laugh and joke as if it doesn't matter? What happened to mercy? What happened to good values? What happened to humanity?. We are all the same just with different experiance, environment and circumstances‍. Shouldn't we value each other and extend a helping hand instead of laughing and judging?

I think this is my 4th time venting here. I have been depressed for almost 2 years now. It didnt start as something really bad. First i started hating myself, then i started complaining, then i started crying, then i started to hate life, then i started to have my education fucked up, then i stared to want to die. One part of my depression is insecurity. I remember being insecure since i was a little kid. I remember always wishing to look like or be someone else, someone who looked better than i was, had better hair and all. I know 2 years isnt much, but being stuck in this shithole, it feels like a lifetime. A lot of people may think depression and being suicidal are for drama queens and so did i before i was depressed but it seriously is an illness that is very hard to fight. The depression and all was okay with me (not so okay but at least it didnt mess with my plans to being a better person) before i got in deeper. Now it gives me thoughts i don't wanna have just  staying in the class listening to what the teacher says. I never do my homeworks cause i get lost in my mind at some point. I really hate myself and i hate how everything works. I am too scared to actually do it but i have suicidal thoughts every day. Even thinking of it makes me near tears. I dont want to disappoint anyone by dying but what less am i doing staying alive? I dont think i won't  have a future i can be proud of, especially when i get zero in every homework and tests. Writing this in a channel where strangers read ur problems isnt gonna help me but no one is there to listen to what i have to say so, yeah.

Hi everyone. I am cold, i really show no emotion to anyone except me. I mean the whole nine yards, I've never confided in anyone except me for the last close to 27 yrs of my existence.

 I've thought about it and somewhat traced it to the way i was raised. All males except mom and no exchange of emotions including my mother (don't get me wrong i really love them).Now i am clearly seeing that it is  late and out of hand, coupled with anxiety from it and really low self esteem i have accepted that i will die alone.

If you met me in real life u would never guess i feel like this, i am a tiny bit sociable and somehow not bad looking. When i try to bond with people i always find myself doing the usual dance of getting very acquainted and then boom i get to the wall, which means the end. It really is frustrating, but i really tried and accepted my fate. It has led me to some irresponsible & bad decisions because it is difficult to see the point.(sometimes i think i had blocked the chance if someone amazing from being born, who actuality could contribute to the society & i am just a waste of resources)

So In this past two years i'v been rly feeling depressed when i start thinking about my future  and what my life is headed. 
I joined the University but i dont have a plan for my life i dont have that drive which i see most of the people around me have,i fear that i will not succeced in life and make my family proud. 
I worry that i will stay at home and be unproductive and be a burden to my family. 
I want to find a passion and be successfully in something where i could earn enough to support myself and help out my family. 
5 years from now i see myself still living with family and being just a burden to them.",nervousness,POSITIVE,0.6145435571670532

Once and for all 
Most of us are tired about hearing you rant about your personal lives. You fuxed his best friend and now you regert it? Yet you're telling half the world about it with vivid details. Have you thought maybe you should try to take responsibility for your shitty values and make things right instead of raving about it on social media. We all love to take responsibility for success and happiness. Hell, we often fight over who gets to be responsible for success and happiness. But taking responsibility for our problems is far more important, because that’s where the real learning comes from. That’s where the real-life improvement comes from. Sitting down and crying won't do you much. Toughen up, it's not all butterflies and rainbows. Matter of fact it never was.",caring,POSITIVE,0.5510032773017883

Hello there,  it is my first time to vent there. Well the thing is that I am not being myself these days... Whenever big things comes to me like something that can change someone's life completely in a good way I just throw it away and feel regretful afterwards. But the strangest thing about me is that I keep telling myself that it is all for good but it doesn't seems like. I am not like that before whenever a good things or chances came to me I run for it even if it is small it just me feel happy just because I challenge myself for that, but nowadays I don't even know what is doing on around me.

The  problem is, He is so mysterious.He always keep his feelings bottled up. Even though  I'm his friend, I don't really know much private details about him. I know he has his problems and issues but he never opens up. I really want to help him but I just don't know how.  Sometimes  I feel like he purposely tries to distance me and when I turn cold  he is like' u r changed '... I'm so confused...

Hey guys. So I'm starting to really believe adults and adulthood is full of shit. No one knows what they're doing. I'm at the brink of joining them legally and it was all rainbows and roses until you really think of it. Follow your dreams, they said. Strive for what you want, theh said. But what is my interests and hobbies don't line up to my future? The future as in the one planned for me by them, by society, by money. I want to do too many things but the amount of choices cripples me. Because at the same time I have none. I want nothing more than to give up this worldly attachment and just discover the world but I can't do that. It terrifies me to think I'll occupy this small corner of my world, this small place I was born and raised in. Be it physically or mentally. It cripples me and I feel claustrophobic. And I think a lot of you feel at least in some part the way I do. But maybe it has been long unaddressed. A lot of you are bothered by relationships and your studies but sometimes don't u want your curiosity to take ahold of you? Your passions to get off the back burner? Because I do. And it sucks because that just makes me stuck in the loop forever. They say ignorance is bliss. They're right.

Mad cause i cant complain, its just am not allowed to. Tired of the consuming thoughts in my head when ever i am alone. Feeling like i want new people new place for a change but really what i want to change is myself. Never attaching to anyone or even socializing just to make myself feel better about not being wanted.

Tl:dr I'm sick, depressed and want to die. I just needed a place to silently scream at the top of my lungs. I don't really know where to turn anymore, so I guess I'll vent here. I struggle asking for help from the people in my life, because I don't want them to know how much I hurt. I just got so much pent up tears and pain, that I don't know how to let out. It feels like a scream is always stuck in my chest, but I can never let it show. I've been sick for so long now, I don't even know how it feels to be ok anymore. Sick in the body, and sick in the mind. So I wore a mask, carrying on even tho it hurts. Now it's cracking up, and my broken mind is starting to show through. I tried to ask for help, but no one answers. No one answers the phone, my doctor is too busy, and the youth senter is always full. I just want to scream at the top of my lungs until I run out of air. I wish I didn't want to die. I don't even know why I wrote this, I guess I just needed to get it out.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9985472559928894

I thought I gave up my virginity to my first love (we only did it once n broke up) but then a year later I met this guy online and we connected (we had too much chemistry) and the third time we met we did it but then I bled like a virgin. I don't understand how. He treated me so well but I felt like a whore. And it doesn't look like he likes me like a girlfriend. Now he asked me to come over and finish what we started.

Am i a psychopath??????        For the past 8 months, i had a sincere crush on a girl and my bestfriend was her intimate boyfriend. But know i am astray , estranged. Partly to what i said to her but more importantly the role which her arche nemesis played in using me as an escapegoat for his contrived and diabolical plot. I played the role which he set me up to since i thought that i can be the badguy and move on. But my actions had a ripple effect and i  got estranged with almost everyone whom i was acquainted with. But conversely, i feel rejuvenated and ever alife. I am happy off the outcome. I can totaly exist without a parade. It feels so good to be me again, incontrol of myself.

I am not here to vent but to ask a question. I have been closely following vents being posted here and most of them are about depression and suicidal tendencies. I want to take the initiative to try and tackle this issue. So I am asking those who are depressed and suicidal,  how are you trying to self medicate? Is it drugs, alcohol, seeing a professional, only venting, keeping it a secret from everyone? and how is it working for you? Have you tried to look for a professional? Was it easily available to you or not? if not...why? Is it expensive? Unavailable? Are you ashamed? Etc....

Like a week back I posted a silly meme on instagram about taking it to the next level with a friend( it was a random post, didn't really mean anything by it).But a few friends hit me back up saying how relieved  they were that I finally had the balls to ask her out and the funny thing was they all referring to the same person. Obviously I denied it saying it's just a stupid post but now that I think about it there might have been some truth to what they said. Although the friend in question and I aren't actually that good of friends we still joke around and flirt in class like I do with most people. Plus we keep in touch but that's not hard to do when you're in the same class in college. I honestly have never thought about all this until just now...so my question is, is the person we're supposed to be with already in our circle? Our friends, classmates, people we say hi to in the hall... Do we subconsciously surround ourselves with the people we need and they are just oblivious to us but so apparent to others?

There is this popular saying that says stg like 'when people show u their true colours believe them the 1st time' I think it was meant to say in plain words don't make excuses for people's behavior, acknowledge its what they wanted to do instead of building scenarios why he or she did what they did, just believe they meant to do exactly that... Its in our nature to fight for what we want no matter the circumstances, u want what u want and u want to get it, even if there is always a gray area, it also as simple as that. 
The other meaning I get from the quote is we tend to paint people with the mistakes of others, we tend to scratch them with the scars other left, which leads me to a question: Do we really see a person for who they are with out our own mistakes and others reflecting through? Every fight or encounter can it b purely because of that particular scenario or is it 59% because of unsurfaced issues and unhealed scars that's r with in every 1 of us?",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9960380792617798

Vent Here Bot:
Lately I've been stresses out about a lot of things like a loooot ppl say that the younger u are the less stress u have or have no stress sure no one is being killed or anything but it's a stressful life and rapid society we are living in, for me my stress is school my mum woke me up every night for 2 weeks  to study for matrick and school has been stressful and i lost 7 kg and was also sick I just I dont know how I'll be able to pull it all off, and then there's nxt year coming and  i have some friends in the higher grade and there not exactly having the time of their life u spit blood until u succeed or end up fruitless,   im just so scared I just have to pray and relax and enjoy life with my friends but the moment there's nothing with me like my friends, my phone, my movies... I start thinking about my future analysing everything, if I'll really stay with my bf for that long, if I'm still gonna be religious layer in life, if I'm gonna stay virgin till marriage, all these things cloud my mind and idk what to do or who would listen to all these things cuz my bf would over analyse these small details and get to stressed out like me or comfort me in just not ready to make that move yet but I know taking all this and keeping it all in is not good and is not healthy maybe thats why I'm starting to act out and react violently to ppl close to me(family) idk what to do",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9986415505409241

Hi every on my name is nina i am not here to vent just to speak a piece of mind. I am not trying to be pessimistic but i feel like the reason why most of these venters(teens) face the problems they are is due to the need to be special. Most of us grew in a house hold where our parents give us 3 meals a day, comfortable beds to sleep in, enjoyment through tv, phones and other means. They tell us that we are the best, that we can have it all , that we r special. But what most parents fall to tell is that we r a nobody once we are out of our house hold. Nobody cares if we are ok or not.
The point where the problem arise is when we have a huge group of kids together thinking they are special. They think they r so special they find the need to show they r better than there peer leading to a hell lot of drama. They think unwise things and do them. They find the need to have every once attention and approval. They tend to say they feel emotions that they donot even to understand. a silly example can be kids claming to fall deeply in love and kiss while they r in 4th grade. Call me crazy but kids these days need to know they r not the center of universe and that they can know it all. If we get this trough there head maybe things would be easy",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9856067895889282

Hello everyone!
I've been chatting with some man on messenger for a month now, we talk about almost everything. Starting from how our days went to explicit secrets, i for one, have never been this relaxed while talking to a guy. He just gets me before i speak my mind. And that gives me butterflies. Some day when we were talking, he opened up to me about something that i did not expect he would; he said he has two kids and that he was married before. I was surprised at his openness, after all we only know each other on social media and he could just cat fish me about anything. I like him a lot, but i feel dumb as well that i'm giving in very easily. Plus to someone who had a past, a past i can't adjust. I don want to indulge myself into any serious thing, but with the magnitude of our connection that seems a near sight. help me out?!! What am i supposed to do?! I've been hurt before and i've been a locked up persona since. i know its not right, but its my defense mechanism. I just wanna enjoy having fun but am just to scared he would just use me for random sex and then forget it all. At this point, i just don know what to do.",fear,POSITIVE,0.854745626449585

This one is not a vent but an advice for the young people .
Just now, I heard that my childhood best friend, whom we grew apart, was molested (raped) by some people who no one knows of . Back then we use to hang out until he disappeared for almost a year . We all thought he did that on purpose because of his abusive father and we were all shocked and time went by. After a year, he was found by his father's friends at a very far place  looking all sick and kind of hurt in a way that was noticable  . After that he was never the same around us. Specially around me and my family. He almost always used to hung out with us at home  but after that he started avoiding us and we thought well it's puberty or sth . Little did we know that he was abducted by some ppl and they molested him and kept him with them all that time . He told this only to his grandmother who is such a selfish old bitch who doesn't give a fuck about anything except her self even to report this to the police . Now It's been almost 5 years since ive  seen him . Listening to this now , not earlier, makes me rly sad and angry at the same time. He was my best friend,I could  call him my brother . But after what happened to him, he was just a different person . He became very shy and depressed, it's noticable.
Anyways guys I just wanted to say please be careful around people you don't know. Don't just go to some places alone. Don't ever say yes when a stranger offers to give u a lift. This applies to boys and girls. These times are fucked up. And please if you ever had this happened to you, don't let it ruin your life. Make  those ppl pay for their doing.
P.s sry for my English but I hope y'all understood me.

Out of all the emotions I experience on a daily basis, the one that fascinates me the most is... fear
more specifically the fear of death.
It's the engine that drives most of my actions. It is the only emotion that I've enjoyed wrestling with. Because,I know that once I've harnessed it along with reason I'll find life to be much more bearable. To put it simply the fear (or rather the meditation ) of death allows me to live life in the present.
It has been said countless times that one should live everyday as if it was his last, But few seem to heed this advice. I for one have spent most of my short time here on earth thinking about the future while neglecting the present. But the present is a jealous lover, once she knows you've lifted your eyes off of her, she'll make sure your future is no more. Because the health of your future dependes on how you treat your present.
If you realise that you might die at any moment and that tomorrow was never guaranteed, you'll use your days to do the things you've been putting off for so long.
sayings like this have gotten to be cliches but their truth is eternal.
That's why i always remind myself of my close proximity to the reaper.

THE CLOSER YOU THINK YOU ARE TO DEATH: 
THE MORE YOU'LL START TO PRIORITISE IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE.

THE CLOSER YOU THINK YOU ARE TO DEATH:
THE MORE YOU'LL REALISE PAIN AND SUFFERING ARE TEMPORARY 

THE CLOSER YOU THINK YOU ARE TO DEATH:
THE LESSER YOU'LL THINK OF YOUR OTHER FEARS",joy,POSITIVE,0.7778945565223694

Here we go. So I’m a freshman university student who’s good looking with them curly hairs dimples and everything you ask for a man to be. The problem is am not happy! “With my love life” 
     Girls just text me through my telegram and instagram idk if it’s my looks or behavior they heard about. And btw I pretty have too much Sex. I just meet someone new and we might just kick it right there or some where else the exact day we met or i just be talking to someone for three days online and just fuck on the weekends and that’s not fun! My soul too soft for “just sex.”
    Even last night we were sleeping over at my friend house kewchi selmta so i met this girl there she’s hot i admit and her toes werenails are my weakness Btw and i ended up hitting it after the first round bitch started confessing that she know my name and that she texted me on telegram and that I didn’t replied and shit. The next morning i had a date with another person at edna to watch a movie so we went in and ended up getting a BJ at the cinema 
    And this is not what i want to be honest i just want someone who just be there for me someone who’ll make me feel that everything is going to be alright someone that’ll make me feel loved!
    So is this a serious problem? Should i get checked? Any psychology students here? What is wrong? Y’all give me advices. 
        

                   I know all this feels like a lie cause if you have a life like this you won’t even be in the channel but look at me right. but am sure there are so many peoples out there who get me.   Thank you for reading send me your replies",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9983154535293579

I have vented plenty times here about depression and so. I feel sad pretty constantly, i can't look at myself as a person who can succed in any way, i dont appreciate anything about me both physically and personally. Sometimes i feel like id be better off dead. I am scared of death but i just wish i never existed or suddenly disappeared. These days i feel like all i am feeling is fake....not like im taking a step into being happy but i feel like im just convincing myself these so i people feel sorry for me. I feel like im hurt deep inside but then i feel like thats a lie i tell myself. I feel like another crap who cant be a better person. I am confused on who i am. Is this depression or just a lie in my head? I have been ""depressed"" for about a year and a half. I can't enjoy special moments like my friends. My grades are lower than ever. I feel hopeless.

Anyways theres a problem in addition to this. So since summer came we called n texted but it wasnt like before we always argue n fight over stupid things and he has no idea hw many times he hurted me with out knowing. Anyways at some point i told him that she has a thing for him and it bothers me a lot ena he jokes abt it, it was kinda funny at first but now its kinda mean. Anyhow after our last hangout he called 2days later n told me his phone is stollen and he hasnt called for a week n few days. And all this and other staff are just draning my love for him(ik cheesy).My besti is tellin me to break up wat should i do n how.",amusement,NEGATIVE,0.9975637197494507

Baby you know yesterday was the worse. When I am thinking it's working I am starting to let go and move on, yesterday's kind of days happen. And yesterday in particular was the worse so far. My God I was in pain. Literally in pain. I felt my heart contracting and not letting go. I really felt it. It felt like I was having a mini heart attack. I swear to God it was real physical pain. I really don't know what to do anymore. Bc I can't seem to move on or forget you. Bc if today is a better day then I know the next few days would revolve around you.....maybe I should just give up.

Over the past two years I've learned that certain stereotypes hold true to most people. The first being girls fucking love a guy they can fix. it's ok for a guy to be relatively douchy as long as she can make him less so. The second   thing is the more you want a girl the more power she has over you. Next is the very surprising fact that guys fall in love way too quickly than girls. lastly don't believe anything that comes out her mouth with regards to her ideal man. most girls would give you a generic answer when you ask them what kind of guy they like but their actions is way more informative.",surprise,POSITIVE,0.9752487540245056

They are so fucked up n i hate it.

Guys fall fo my staring eyes n cute smile especially,,, This happened to me ever since I got to high school till now.

Hey everyone! Here is my vent, I actually don't have a problem or depression or anything bad. I had an argument with my hubby not an argument but more like a disagreement, so here is the thing we have been living together for almost 4 months now, usually people think I am so weird and have a lot of weird things other people don't have or even say or do, I mean I know that and I am happy with what I am, and ever not even once want or try to change. Anyways let me tell you some of my things that he thinks are weird and I think is not because from all this people someone out there should have the same thing as me. First is: I can't sleep on a slippery or chiffon kind of bed sheet fabrics ""yemyakatlhu"" that's how I describe them, because when ever I sleep on them or wear a chiffon kind of fabrics, it makes me burn not like burning when it's hot but really burning. Second: I can only sleep with one side of my body which is my left, it should always be like that or it will bother me. Third: I need things to be as i put them, my house should always be clean and organized other wise I'll be uncomfortable specially the toilet, it must be clean as a kitchen. The last but not list I hate it when people I don't know touch me, like I hate hand contacts it makes me so uncomfortable, and I don't wanna see my hubby doing that to any human kind, I feel like he is over stepping when he gets around and touch people, don't take this in the wrong way because when I say touching like a normal touch but to much for someone you just met . because he touch people unintentionally most of the times, for him it doesn't matter if he knows them well or not, and for me it's not okay, I think no body should be touching anybody, I am the kind of person that don't even  believe in hand shake. So it always makes me uncomfortable when he do that.

Hey guys
I don't know if this is helpful...my first time doing this...so try to help out over here
I never thought this would turn out to be a real problem for me...but it is right now
Here's the thing...there's this guy I liked ever since I was a kid...we kind of grew together...I don't remember not knowing him
And I've developed some feelings for him just when I was less than 10...wow
So...it has been some time now..since I figured my feelings for him...and it was like a tree planted years ago.. very deep roots that are hard to just get rid of. Things happened...he figured out about me mnamn...that's another story but no matter what he did to make me forget abt him and no matter All the things I figured out(like him having a girlfriend that he has never told me abt all that time) , I just can't stop loving him.
Love didn't treat me the way it did with my friends and all...all I've experienced is pain...and a little hopeless hope In it
I wanna get over him....I'm not a relationship seaker....it's not the term ""boyfriend "" I want
I need someone better than him to make me forget abt him...but then I push away everyone
Whenever I get a chance...he's the one pooping in my mind...I admit I'm not over him..but I want to
There is 0% probability I might get to him...there's distance and feelings bcha...I'm scared of starting over
Forget being scared. I can't  start over
It's like trying to plant a new tree on a ground where there used to be another tree...but cut off...but still the deep and huge roots exist

Hey guys....so I was seeing these guy for a couple of months now and we met through some situationship and he started texting me and calling me we used to talk like for hrs literally and he was kinda confusing he was kinda different from all the guys that I've dated before. he took me on a road trip for our first date then we had lunch and after that he got really attached like he told me to call him every time I got out of class and he wanted me to call him everywhere I go and such and had couple of arguments and he always apologise .... I wanted to be frank with him so I told him that he has that player vibe and he told me he will prove me wrong then after that we had a couple of dates he made sure that I was happy to the fullest then he told me what happened with his ex and all then some part of me just forgot that player side I thought he had with in him then on our 4th date we made out like crazy  then after that he didn't call me for a day or 2 and since he had a job I understood very well but while looking at the hicky he left I kinda felt bad I don't even know why then I got over it and then he called me on the 3rd day and acted like nothing happened and acted all like he was all about work and noting in between and I was kinda confused  then I shrugged it off then the next day he told me he won't come around but I saw a girl in his car and he passed by and the next day he came and he always have this tendency to make me forget what just happened and make me belive that there's nothing maybe that's just the part of me that felled for him already then he took me out ""abren enafter belo before Ramadan ended"" so I agreed to his terms then he told me for the very first time he loved me and i asked him why he hadn't told me earlier and he told me that ""setoch chger alebachu I love u setebalu"" and I kinda felt bad becha he drove me home menamn ena after that we barely talked then I found out he was also texting this other girl(which is a friend of my friend ) I so mad and felt like a fool I immediately texted him that I thought he was better than that and I told him to have self respect and he was so mad he texted some shit and I liked the fact that I got him mad and I was so sad for all the girls he played he definitely used them and I the worst part is that I'll see him everyday and I'm so mad at the fact that he considered me a fool ...did I do the rite thing?

We live in a society where it is standard to have your first kiss in middle school (maybe earlier now), to have your first boyfriend in high school and to lose your virginity by, if not in, college. I am the exception to this norm. I am 21 years old, and I am still virgin. It is and it isn’t by choice. I am not throwing myself at people in order to “lose it,” but I am also not saving myself for marriage or for any other religious motives. It’s frustrating when you feel like you’re growing up slower than all of your friends and you can’t figure out why. You ask yourself over and over again why you can’t just make yourself grow up. I’ve played that game enough times to know that you can’t make yourself grow up.Things happen when they’re supposed to, when it’s right.That usually comforts you until your friends start talking about sex, which happens a lot, and you have nothing to contribute to the conversation. No funny stories, no advice. Just quietly listening, wondering if your friends think you’re weird, which obviously they don’t, but you feel like an outsider nonetheless. It shouldn’t be embarrassing, but it is.The purpose of this article is to let anybody else out there who is still a virgin, no matter what your age or gender or reasons for waiting, it’s alright. I mull this over a lot in my head, I’m content knowing that it will happen when it’s supposed to. Just do you and then things will fall into place.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9837146401405334

Here lies reality.
 The life of a good man costs!
 I am a committed person I commit to almost everything I value in life but trust me when I say ""its a disease"".
I mean it has given me everything in my work life,
 But when it comes to a relationship I enjoyed life better when I didn't have to trust a woman to hold me down. I haven't came across any woman who would realise what I am as a man until its too late to resume.
lemme leave you with this thought...
What if your beauty, curves isn't the reason, what if the words you say, the person you are, and the genres of music you listen too matters
Hypothetically speaking of course 

Not every man wants to digg a hole. I mean I might be that guy but am pretty sure there are some men tired of the usual. They are tired of not being trusted just because of an insecurity that came from feelings.
So they are always hurt.
One things a constant tho the assholes ALWAYS make it.

Ofcourse everyone is afraid of rejection but mine, Man mine is out there. When I'm being  totally honest with my self here is what I figured out or still figuring out? (i don knw ) ....I think I'm likeable by everyone, like i think everyone finds me attractive  I know! what da hell ight? trust me I know that is massed up but I think it has something to do with comments/complements I have been getting since I was a little girl you know teachers putting u on front of the line when taking group pictures, everyone telling how cute u are ever single time. That's the kinda situation I grow up in. That's really wrong BTW raising a girl only telling her she is pretty cause she is gonna think that's the only thing going for her. U have to tell her she is strong,smart n that she can do anything she sets her mind on shit like that cause when she meets people who are more attractive than her or people who don't find her all that pretty she is gonna feel like crap! So wrong society!! Anyways I met this guy n I thought we clicked n he did ask for my number but it's been 2 weeks n he never called and I was like ""why didn't he call? guregna new malt new or maybe he thinks I wasn't in to it"" I never stopped and think like "" maybe it was me, he didn't find me all that funny n cute"" and that is soo wrong! Anyone can be attractive to a certain some one and not to other. That's the ugly truth I have to swallow, that we all have to swallow. you're friends might think you're smart but u ain't smart to everyone. as a person u can be mature, for others u might not be mature enough you know?

This rock oribits the sun and the sun will one day end up swallowing it whole. Now compare your worries to this. 98% of the things we worry about don't even end up happening. I do not mean to make your worries seem insignificant. Rather i am trying to lessen the weight they have on you. Don't worry and fret too much. Every time something brings you down, get out of your head and look around you. Look at all the people, trees, animals, down to the soil beneath your feet.

I would be sick if I hear one more person using the word psychopath. No, you're not a psychopath. Who are you to diagnose yourself? And No, you can't become a psychopath. Psychopathy is a serious mental illness affecting one percent of the population. It's becoming one of those words. Please stop.

And another thing we should stop is romanticizing and glorifying depression, sadness and suicide. How are you gonna get out of it if you keep identifying yourself with it? And don't say you're depressed when you are merely sad. Stop the self-pitying and the everything-and-everybody-is-against-me attitude.

I'm sure they will get along with my absence really well in fact they will enjoy it I promise. If you, the reader, are one of them I'm really not sorry if my words or action are or will hurt you because in my point of view they are the right thing, as a human you and maybe I are selfish so get lost.

After that happened I didn't do anything, didn't say anything..I just ignored both of them completely and now it's been 2 months since then and she still is insisting I talk to her.
My question is should I? If i let it out I don't know what I might do...I'm not an aggressive person but when shit happens around me I can't control my self..sooo pls help me out ppl

Hey fellow vents or unicorns or whatever. I am what you would call an close minded individual or introvert . I have been like this since I could count digits. I like keeping to myself and being alone. This may sound strange but let it be. This has caused me to have low social interactions and hence few true 'friends'. After high school ended, this so-called group of friend I knew since preschool were left displaced into different universities where I ended up in Gondar and none of us ended up in the same university. Anyways Im getting off topic. But I tried to evolve and develop connections here at my university. After 2 years now, I seem to get the hang of it with  certain classmates. One of which is a girl who I have been 'close' with for the past year. She is what you would call a deep extrovert. She thinks she is in a relationship with me even though I don't do that much to facilitate it by calling or texting or meeting her every day or week. But my question is now that I might have a chance of a scholarship and nobody knowing about it, how should I break the news to her?",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9980387091636658

For all of you battling with depression...
For your own sake you have to grasp how little your problems are. I know this is harsh, and before you kill me in the comments hear me out...
 Try and see how others do have it worse, how they have dealt with much much worse than you and some how are still going. You can find strength in that, and kinda fight it.
This way won't work for all it did for me, even though my life was a basic shitstack. I think this will help all those with the will to live, who wanna try. But for those who don't, I wish I could lessen your pain somehow, so sincerely ayzoh/ayzosh",desire,NEGATIVE,0.9657300114631653

Hey Unihorse .

I need to vent.
Hello, 1st time venting. Its about a guy whom i love dearly. So here's z problem when me and him started he wasn't single so we had it going on in secret since we're all in z same school and stuff. Z hardest thing in the world is lovin someone so bad and watching them love someone else the same way but i also took that inside and acted like everythin was fine just b/c i love him. 
So after this secrecy continued all of a sudden they broke up (not because of me). And this had no effect on us so after a few month he asked me to be his girlfriend and well he owns my heart from day 1 so yeah i said YES. But still we were'nt official like he wouldn't even say hi in school. It was all texting. 
So i asked him why one day and he told me he lovED his previous girlfriend and didnt wanna hurt her by moving on that fast. Okay that hurts, wanting someone so badly and getting nothing b/c if his past feels like shit. 
Things changed and he forgot all about her (atleast i think he did) and things between us was going perfect and still is. But when i call him and if his wiz his friends he talks as if im just a friend, he still doesnt want them to know! 
He loves me and is all about the longterm but he cant do this simple thing? If he loves me as much as he does why does he make me feel inferrior and less by not tellin anyone abt me? 
Y is it in a small argument he doesnt call if i dont and act like everythin is fine? 
Please i need some advice its killing me!",love,NEGATIVE,0.99454665184021

Because of that I lost my sexual interest in him and every time we have sex it is as painful as hell. That really traumatized my sex life with him and he doesn't understand that and asks for sex every chance he gets.

I'm 18 and currently stressing my self to death over something that may or may not wield a very positive effect.
This is more of a ""what would you do if you were in my shoes?"" kind of question than a vent.
If you had a chance to create a better life for yourself abroad and live your life in a certain manner where you simply cannot have ""fun"" and stay distant from someone you hold dear for a long time but can, at least, help out a single parent that raised you by herself from the very beginning, would you take it? Or would you follow your dream, if efficacious, can grant you a life where money, fame, looks, etc wouldn't matter a bit. You might say that this is an easy choice but dependant on so many obstructions. And you're right. I kept y'all in the dark. But in a sense, if you take the first option, you'll live a fair life, and create one for your guardian. If you take the second option, you'll be taking a risk of failure aligned by backstabbers, idiots, and wicked people plus you may empty your parents' bank account. But in the end, it'll be worth it all because things that usually stress average Joe's won't simply matter.

Uhm... I dont know how to say this right. I'm so confused u have no idea ...
My moms living in the states she left 5 years ago and my dads living here in Addis with me and sis ..
I just graduated from highschool and my plan was go to the states and learn there ...it was mostly planned im not goanna go into the minutae of my educational plans but now my dad tells me i can't go cuz I goatta watch over my sis, he wants me to stay in Addis, he doesnt even want me leaving the city ...
We didnt have a proper conversation bout me moving to the US but in a way he knew. I didnt talk to him cuz he gets abusive when things dont go the way he has planned.
My mom got mad cuz she planned a lot of things for when i went to the US. We talked bout it ever since 5 years ago when she left.
 Now they both saying dff things.

My dad tells me i sgould stay here and that my mom wants to have me with her so she can get a green card or sth, my mom tells me well sth weird i cant talk bout . Bicha even now they goatta put my life in the middle of their fight... they dont agree with eachother, one of them tells me the others statement is totally fake .. that theyre telling me this to use me 
And again i have to choose wc ones lying and wc ones telling the truth, they always get in the middle of my life, everything has to be a choice bn him nd her. Its very exasperating. 
When it comes to choosing he has a reputation of lies and threats and she left me here with him but she told me its cuz he threatened her or sth... 

Ayiiii... i know  confusing, you should see how i am right now

Hello everyone. so here is what's bugging me. I see a lot of engineering students venting about how much they hate there field and regret choosing it so I wanna ask is everyone like that I mean is it that bad? I finished high school this year and I really don't know what I want to learn, and don't tell me to listen to my heart or some thing like that because I tried and it didn't work. I have good grades so I really don't wanna ruin my future. And is every field under engineering the same when it comes to getting a job or is it only civil engineering that is bad?
Thank you",gratitude,NEGATIVE,0.9963122010231018

And after 5 months of continuous chats, I fall for her, but I couldn't tell her since she's not interested in relationships.

I came to that point cuz  my last two relationships .... I guess not relationships more like encounters with love left me more of a mess than I was... after each I swore never again ... I still don't know how i got through each but I just have this insecent need to find a deep connection with someone I guess and so... more cynical and more In pieces I still try... but it's not just my feelings that were hurt... I have a habit of being reckless when I feel intense emotion...like when I am. angry or in pain I guess....so  I just said. fuck it to my classes... and didn't give a shit... that scared me but I couldn't snap out of it ... I went in to tests unprepared and had on this Indifference if I failed or passed..... looking back it was very stupid and I know my grades kinda sucked and that will have its own mess.... with all the effect and I guess pain it caused me .... I want to stop.... but on the other hand idk it was good to have somebody who understood ..... but I do have a lot of stuff to fix about my self .....like don't even get me started on that.... but if I stop I feel like I am gonna miss out and I don't know....it doesn't seem like I have much choice cuz I am so messed up but still I am having trouble deciding ....so what do you think i should do",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9982695579528809

We've been best friends for 2 years and everyday he says ""i love you"" and i say it back...i meant it...every damn time..... I dont know what to do anymore.

Hey guys what's up? I'm a guy and I'm 27 and I wanted to share my problems with u and hope u can help me get rid of it.

Lately i've been thinking that my life is filled with fake ppl in it (except close family tho)...fake distant relatives, fake friends, fake work friends becha all fake in general. My parents are wealthy but I don't give a fuck about that, never did my whole life because I wanna make my own money and not be a brat sitting all day being spoon fed. But now that I think of it...most of my close friends are here for the money and not me. The reason why I said this is...going back 7 or 8 years ago I had no friends...I was socially awkward and my parents bought friends for me malet yechalal ( they used to come by at School get the whole class lunch, they used to invited them to my home for my bday party and shit ) becha that's how I got friends which is totallyyyy ridiculous. And those friends are the ones still here and I keep thinking are they still here for the money? They always ask me for it tho‍

Work friends too( I'm the CTO, chief technical officer, at a big company) so those ""friends"" laugh at my stupid jokes, make fun of me when I'm not there and act all serious when I'm around and shit...bc they know I'm their boss and that I can fire them. 

My question is how can I get real friends? Where do i even look without them wanting my money?",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9991058707237244

Hey there buddies!
It not really a vent but instead a question. Here Goes 
I am a 22 years old girl and I never had a bf. 
 I know many men and they say they are interested in me but I just don't believe them... And when ever they try to approach me in an intimate way, I drift away or I want them to try harder.
I do this not cause I wanna play hard to get or to play with their emotions, but it's cause I have trust issues with men. 
I have seen a lot of my girlfriends being hurt by the men they love... when I come to the main Q ( I know ur saying, eskahun wedegedelew algebachim? Min yihen Hulu azebarekat? I said all this to tell u that I don't know how men react when they are truly interested in a girl or they are 'here' for just the cookie ) 
Bear with me a little bit 

I recently have met a handsome guy, like really really hansome, And he took my # just 5 days ago, but he called for like 4 times a day, text in between. And he's acting like my bf, and asks me to meet with him everyday. I dont like rushing things so I haven't met him again yet...

Guys! Do u think he's rushing things cause he did really liked me, or is it cause he just wants the cookie and he's playing me, and I'm just another new target? Do guys rush things with a girl they truly like & not lust

Hey guys, so I currently find myself in a difficult situation with a friend of mine. So we met in highschool when him and I happened to be the same class. The guy is pretty odd in character and makes really unfunny, weird jokes. It's really tough to be around him, unless you have a high level of tolerance, which I happen to have. On the bright side, I also like him because he's the most honest and pure of heart person you could know, also very rare. He is very ""sociable"", he talks to random people if he gets the chance. He knows a lot of people and hangs out with different groups. But I know for certain that each one of his acquaintances can't stand him, but won't tell him that to his face. They either call him up as a backup plan or to buy them stuff(he's loaded). But then he tells me that he feels somehow lonely and that I am his bestfriend and the only person he trusts. Now don't get me wrong, i don't hate the guy but I really pity him and I am concerned about him and the relationship he's building with other ppl. I always think about telling him to cut down on his really awkward & uncomfortable talks but I know he will be very emotional about it and broken. But at the same time, if I, the only person who genuinely cares about him, don't do it, who will?? This is a tough one for me because deep down he's a really good person.

Surprisingly it was awesome as fuck   i even kissed her later at night. But the problem is I think she is still scared and after that day we talk and all but i can still feel something is wrong. I really like her more now but I don’t see the affection from her side and i dont wannu lose her bec she is perfect to me i dont wannu do anything that might push her away

Fast forward this year I’m still on about her but luckily some friend introduced me to her, she was even better than her looks, she had the personality of the century, and like the voice of a harp and her eyes, they were deep and beautiful and to this day I still haven’t gotten that close and I’m really putting in effort to do so, maybe one of these days I’ll let you know how it goes down, wish me luck though cuz this one is really special

There are so many reasons that we shouldn't be together. But this one reason got me thinking maybe he is the right one for me. Maybe I'll never feel this way for anyone else. What do you think?

Hey guys. How are y'all? Well I need help with my boring ass love life. I'm a 15 year old guy who has not dated since the 6th grade. I'm a nice guy, but it feels like I never get the chance to date. I have a lot of friends which are girls but never more intimate. Either they don't wanna link or I'm not trying at all. I'm a little of the flexing type but I'm not cocky at all like why are girls almost never close me?

This is going to be long...
 
I want you to clear your mind. Take all the bullshit we've been taught, expectations we've been given and the limit we've been having and cram it all in a closet. 

So if you are reading this you are a human. Probably. And you are an organism. Maybe. You have multiple organ systems. And those organ systems have organs in them. And those organs have tissues. And those tissues are made from a bunch of cells. Those cells have organelles.  And those organelles are made from amino acids, sugars and all that crap. And those in turn are made from molecules bonded to each other. Those molecules are made from atoms. And those atoms from proton, neutron and electon.  And those from quarks and lepton and so on and so on.

Now this brief ride in biology is to show you that there are more atoms in your body than there are stars in a observable universe! And that is a lot. Doesn't this make you feel humongous? Make you feel big?

And now let's see the world around us. We are on earth, living as a slightly evolved form of primates living on a dirt planet revolving around an avarge star. A star among the billions found on this avarage spiral galaxy. This galaxy is among a billion others found in this universe. Or maybe it is multiverse. We don't know.

Doesn't that make you feel tiny? So insignificant?

Hi everyone.
First of all this is a long vent with a lot of gibberish. 
I am seeing a lot of people in this channel venting about gfs, bfs, dating and whatsoever. But the issue is that I have been an introvert guy all my life. I kept to myself, said as few words as I could muster . I was a smart student up until I was around 14 years old. When I heard about things  that a normal kid should know about like sex and related stuff. My grades immediately slipped and went from 1st to 10th. My grades didn't recover from since. I don't really care about that cause I managed to keep my cool. I was also a home kid. I didn't go out unless it was for class. I didn't even go out to family social events unless I was forced. I think the situation somehow made me feel nothing for sex and dates and whatsoever. I am now 20 years old with an experience of no gfs and no dates till now. My question is
Is there something wrong with me? Are there individuals like this here? Should I give an effort to change my whole personality even if my current path might lead to a good job and lonely future which I'm fine with but the other might lead to an unstable future from previous experience(I'm not hoping)?",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9976511597633362

Caught in Emotion
I never thought that I was capable of love. At the beginning, it was all fun. But as days pass by, you start to become real. You start having more meaning than you ever did. The matter of fact, more than any one. I never felt this way, so I was afraid of falling so fast. Because I wasn’t sure you were ready to catch me when I land. So even unintentionally, I started looking for ways to end this feelings. Cause deep down I knew it was all just a game for you. I was hoping you would be the only person to ever be in that position. But life doesn’t go as planned right?

At the time, I was afraid of my feelings. I wanted you to be the one that show me I was wrong to push you away. But your words started to say different while your actions said sth else. I was just the girl you had on your fingertips who was just waiting for you to act right and treat her right, huh? Whenever you wrote paragraphs about how sorry you are and how you wanted to try harder while I started to drift, then BOOM I’m back. Is that how low you think of me??? You really hurt my feelings when you agreed to my suggestion of timeout. You didn’t even try. I had so much going on in my life that I wanted you to be my escape from those horrible things. But who am I kidding?? You never cared, you were just really good at pretending. You made me feel stupid for all those times I spent being on your side. I fucking sacrificed my sleeping hours I had just for you. 

You knew what were doing to me but you had the audacity to come into my life when I was adjusting to new me. Weeks passed without even saying hi. You started to disappear whenever you saw me. For starters, I didn’t start this but for some reason you made it like I was the one who was chasing you. Bruhhhhhh 

Then again you act like it’s all cool and start to be the angel. You are true evil. You never deserve this kinda part in my life. I’m glad it ended. Don’t ever comeback. You should have known I don’t play your stupid games. You will be a lesson that if I can be like this for a mf, I can imagine what I can do for the right one. So happy to start new beginnings in a place where you will never ever find me or see me. Save your plagiarized paragraphs of forgiveness and shit, and stay the fuck out of my life.  You should have believed me when I said I don’t chase, I replace them. I guess I’m too much of a woman while you are just a boy‍. Chunk my two fingers",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9612693190574646

I will say this with all the guilt and the shame I am feeling. But I am not doing this 'coz am a heartless woman rather it's coz am a hopeless lover. In the last six month I started talking to my very first love;(I was the reason why we never were together) but then all this feeling that I succeeded in to suppressing. For the last 8 eight years rushed back in to me. And for the reason that isn't still clear for things suddenly became physical just physical. The problem is he has a girlfriend; a serious one. And now am the side chick. I can't BELIVE I agreed to that. I couldn't find the gut nor the self respect that I needed to end it. And it seems I keep falling for him harder every time as time goes by. I know it sounds damn and selfish but I seriously couldn't do anything about it.

Hellooooo, 
So here's a thing: i need an honest opinion about what i'm gonna tell you. My friend fell in love with a person who has physical impairment, she really loves him and sees her future with him. He is a very good and quite accomplished gentleman too. The thing, she is scared as f**k to start anything serious. Not b'c of the physique, but since he wants to settle for marriage & she doesn wanna break his heart while she is not sure of many things.

2. societal norms,  stupid judgemental freaks out there.

Among my siblings i feel like I'm the one who gets blamed the most. All the time i end up crying and wishing i was dead. Or so i can run away. But where would i go? My small brother and sister were being rude to our neighbor, i got blamed for it. My mom qnd dads divorce, again im blamed by it because i couldnt choose. I get a single B in my grades, im counted as a failure but none of my siblings even have more than two A's.
Im hated by my family and by myself. I am the one who takes care of my small siblings all the time. They hate that mom doesnt do it often so they think im trying to take her spot. My father used to think i insult him behind his back to my mom or my friends. My big brother hates it when i even speak. Idl what i did. My only escape place is school. When u see me in school i am the happiest and nost carefree person in the world. But thats only what people see me as and what i want to be. I cant tell this to anyone because they wont understand. They all have perfect lives and not so much happens to them. Because of envy i started pushing my friends away. I can't pretend all the time. I have bruises on my leg, all from my dad. I believe im a worthless person. Telling people all my secrets makes me feel vulnerable like they know all about me. And i Dont want that. I cant have a say in my life at all. At the same time i want someone to know. To understand me. But ik if i tell someone i will regret it deeply the next day, like i had betrayed my family. I once told my teacher and i still regret it deeply. For some reason i feel like talking wont help me at all. Looking back at the horrible things that happens to me. I try to make myself believe its almost the same in every family. They just hide it. But i look at the way the fathers look at their children with care and i ask God all the time why cant my dad look at like that instead of hate and disappointment. He doesnt do that to my brother. He cares for him. My brother got two B's and even got a C but my dad didnt say anything. He just told him he will do better. But when i got a B. I was kicked and beaten. I still have the bruises on my leg and face. I dont know what to do..same with my mom. She doesnt say that to any of my siblings. Everyone in my family hates me.

I asked my mom if i can meet my friend outside once. She screamed at me saying that i cant go and that i have to try not to be selfish. Last i checked she was out with her friends the day before this argument and all of my brother's friends were at my house playing games together till they all left to eat outside. I asked if she can come to my house, again a flat out no. Im asking for one friend thats all. But my brother is allowed to bring 14 guys over. Is it because im a female? Is it because of my gender that only i have to take care of my sisters, wake up at 5 on the morning to wake them up, feed them or clean the house or cook or wash the dishes?
Its times like these that make me wish i had money so i can leave. I never tell my parents about my friends because in the end they will make sure that i never talk to them. My mom tore all of my books once when she saw me reading one at 9pm. And it was a saturday. She knows how much books mean to me. They are the only things that make me forget the world i live in. everything i like is hated and banned in the house. I stopped eating five days ago. Only having breakfast to keep me during the day. And of course no one noticed. Did i mention my mom broke my phone because i replied with a Hi to a guy on telegram? Idk why am letting this out. Maybe its because my mom just had another argument with me because i didn't get her coffee or because i want to tell you all that, if you see a friend in depression like me, or in a problem. Dont hesitate to go talk to them before they start to burden themselves with their secrets. Even when they say im fine, be there for them. Dont be quiet. Bye",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9962181448936462

A Guide to worrying.

So, you are worried about something, are you? Might be your crush not liking you back or lusting after an ex while you are with your new boyfriend or maybe worried if boys are after your 'Cookie' *chuckles*. Whatever, the best thing that you can do about it is to think as much as possible about it. Just do absolutely nothing about it and keep on worrying. Cuz that always makes problems go away.

Look at the rest of your country. I'm sure they have never faced a personal crisis or lost family members or been fired or panicked on their life choice or anything most people go through in their lifetime. Because the thing you are worried about is the biggest thing that has happened to anyone on this planet.

No one  has ever gone to war so they wouldn't understand what you are going through. No one has fought to free us from oppression. No one has fought with spears and shields against modern weapons for us not to be colonized. No one has walked kilometers just to get clean water. No one has starved in our third world country. Somehow whatever it is you are worried about justifies you loosing sleep and being a total dick to yourself and everyone around you.

Well, you know best. Luckily we humans live forever therefore you have infinite time to hold yourself back with doubt and fear.

And some how your crush might not like you back or you embarrass yourself in that presentation. We are all going to be laughing at you because we don't have a life or anything to do except to wait and laugh at your demise. 

All 7 billion of us. Even after you're dead, we'll come to your grave every day and form a circle laughing and chanting 'this person made a mistake'.

Because we don't have anything else to do.

Also with that thing you are about to do. No one has ever taken a risk before. You're the first one. And I'm God is watching you in a 70 inch screen holding a gaint popcorn waiting for you to fail because he isn't doing anything like miracles or play chess with Jesus or regulate the speed if light or keep the fucking world moving!

But none of that matters, does it? Because you are worried about your crush not liking you back or lusting after an ex while you are with your new boyfriend or maybe worried if boys are after your 'Cookie' *chuckles*. Whatever, the best thing that you can do about it is to think as much as possible. Just don't do anything about it because no one has ever been in a bad situation before.

Guys, by that I mean the literal dudes in here. Most of you here start venting about your problems with girls and all and generalize your whole vent with a “why are women like this?” Or a “How do I argue with a girl?” Have you ever thought maybe we all have different thoughts and personalities... just cause we have the same gender. Don’t get me wrong females do that too, generalize. But you do it in such a snarky way. Do you realize how superficial you are?! I don’t think so.. you have so many requirements in your head for you to simply consider a girl. I may sound a bit bitter but I’m actually just fed up. I could go on but I doubt the real assholes are actually reading the whole thing. But just want to add to the girls in here that if he really doesn’t see you as you are, don’t ever change for him.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9951522350311279

Before you read this pls keep in mind that I didn't do this to hurt anyone but shit happens. So the situation is a bit complicated so bare with me, I have a gf of almost 6 months and I was absolutely crazy about her at first but as time went on things started to fade. As the months went on my feelings for her stated to die out so i tired to end things but I  couldn't coincidentally she was going through a rough time with her fam so i decided not to do it just yet. Backtrack a few weeks, she went back home to her parents but I had to stay back for summer school ( yay med students). Still me and her kept in touch on the phone during that time I met someone else. I used to see this girl around campus but i never persued it for obvious reasons untill she walked up to me one day and we started talking. She's pretty cool so we clicked quickly to the point that we were getting too close. The thing is i never told her i was with someone. I don't want to go into the details but I might have cheated on my gf and I've been racking my head over this I can't sleep i can't eat but even worse I can't read.

Silent faith
I used to have reasons for everything
Used to give reasons for every failure
And You know that
You're always watching
One failure comes
And the reason may be-it's because you want to teach me something;to make me think of what I did wrong.
That's how I thought of it always.
I used to be up high in the sky;confidence was my inborn quality,but lately, you shrank me..and as always, I tried to reason out...one was ,I started listening to Korean zefen ..zefen is hatyat....so it's a reason to why you would punish me... Or may be, I didn't do my best.  And that would mean you didn't punish me.
You shrank me, I wouldn't say you made me lose confidence,cuz that is not what You do, you're a good good father...a really good one!... Last year I asked you to not let my end be a failure....I've been asking you the same question since then, I've done the right things since then.And now this last try, it was the last one, and you knew or know that, I gave it to you, and I made sure that there was absolutely nothing that I would point out as a reason for failure.  Did it riiiight...day and night, I did my best...those Korean zefenoch...no more listening,but I'm asking You what I did wrong this time.. .was I contemptuous of other people years ago that I had to be punished for 2 years?seriously...

Its about a girl nd its probably too long but here it goes..
We started out as friends at campus four years ago but bedenb ketewaweken mawerat kejemeren buhala i fell for her the way we fall asleep slowly n slowly nd then all at once, after that i could never go back..i cant.. alefelegem 
She is everything i could ask for..i have never known what real love feels until i fell in love with her. 
I love her very existence.. everything she does everything she says its just the most adorable thing..nd we dont even agree on many things..we both are very different ppl, nd its very hard at times but at the end of the day for me all that matters was that i still love her no matter wat. 
Ever since i told her i was in love with her we'v gotten ourselves in a complicated situation with me being her friend nd her dealing with other ppl falling for her as well, it isn't an easy situation especially for her nd i do understand that. 
The problem is(more like the sad reality) ever since we started trying it out...i was never rly good enough. I was more like ""maybe good enough if only..."" Hula if only alew with a list of reasons that i might not be the one for her..nd i still do my best to understand those reasons i rly do...but therez always someone who is better out there for u.. someone older, smarter..someone u could talk to all day..more attractive but the thing is i dont need someone better all i want is u with all your imperfections.. you are my definition of perfect i jst wish that i was yours too. 
I also wish u felt comfortable around me...wish i was the person u go to when ever smt bothers you..wether its a headace or a major family issue..i wanna be there for u. 
I just wish u were sure abt me as i am abt you..you keep saying ""esti enayalen"" woye maybe, i always keep hoping for that time to come when u do choose me..the pain tho is that day might never come nd how can i make peace with that when you're everything i ever wanted. When 5 minutes with you smiling nd looking at u nd not being able to hear a thing is worth the confusion nd sadness that comes all of a sudden. Its like we go to a place that feels as if its perefct nd that its going to work out but then all of a sudden it falls apart again. 
It feels lyk no amount if trying, hoping, wishing nd praying might make u fall for me the same way i did for you..nd i do knw u cant force someone to feel a certain way but i jst wish at least u cared enough abt me that u were afraid of losing me as i am afraid of losing you.

Hey Unihorse .
Hide My Identity.  
I need to vent. 
I feel like no one can ever truly understand me,so what's the point in trying? Not even my mom knows about me. How do u explain to your close-minded,worriesome,over-reactive,over-protective mother that you're borderline bipolar?""Oh,hey mom I have a fucking mental illness!""Which is an actual thing. Right now,I feel hopeless. Like,I just want the earth to crack open and eat me alive. I don't know what the hell I did to deserve this,but I have this. I hate having to live knowing that,if I watch a certain movie,or hear a certain song,I'll break apart. If I think of a certain memory,I'll fall to my knees. And,the worst part is not knowing why. You know,sometimes I wish something bad will happen to me, that I'll walk into the house one day and my mom's lying there unresponsive. Or I get into a car accident and loose my legs. Or I hear my friends talk shit about. Anything. I wish I'll finally have a reason to cry. Because,this is not a life. One time,I was so depressed,I decided to kill myself and end my misery. Then,I sat down with a pen and a piece of paper,to write a letter as to why I killed myself. And I came up blank. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. I have no reason to be the way I am. It's a fuckin nightmare. And I feel like I'm never going to wake up.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9997066855430603

Hello 
So this is my first time venting here and idk how to star or where to start what I want to say... so I don’t want to start with am hurt, my parents did this, my family did that and am depressed as shit and I don’t know how to get out of it. I cut myself so I don’t feel like am a numb, I try my best to interact with people and pretend like am fine and I smile always am a crazy person that my friends love and adore me, my teachers think am crazy because of my craziness in the class room and I pretend like am the happiest person in the world and I get all the love I need and nothing in this world means more than my family and shit but that’s all a shit and not true. Yea my family is super rich and gets me all I want but I pretend like am not rich cause all my life the truth didn’t get me no where. If you didn’t grow up getting something you don’t know how to give it back and that’s what happens with me. I didn’t grow up getting love so Idk how to give it to others. I just got out of a relationship because of the love I can’t give him. He thinks I don’t love him and I don’t care about him but the truth is I do too many things for him I buy him things and stuff cause that’s the way I was raised I think when I do those things I might show him how much he means to me but I guess it wasn’t meant to be. I have a bunch of friends which I love so much but they think I can’t do anything better than then malet just because I don’t show off and I don’t dress up they think am less than them. But the truth is I don’t dress up because I have what I have in my heart and mind I just don’t have the time to protocol myself and most of all I got no one to impress I mean if they want me by the way I dress then why bother to be with me? I don’t go out, I keep my head low. Not because my family doesn’t have the name or that they don’t know wealthy people it’s just I just don’t want to get myself attached to this whole situation and be as heartless as they are right now. They think their money can get them anywhere they want yes it does but can’t never get them the love they deserve. I grew up seeking love and all I want right now is that not anything else but I can’t get that because of my depression and the decision I decide every time. Idk what to say or how to let it all out but it’s killing me inside, I was abused, tortured, beaten, insulted and most of all because of the decisions I made in my life and because of all the decisions my mom made for me I was abused and tortured growing up and now I hate my life. I know what I said is all completely and not understandable but if any one understood what I said give me some advice if not all I wanted was just to let something out my chest so thank you for reading this.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9924525618553162

Is it really that bad to want to die? How could god want you to live when he knows your living in misery? And that is if he exists which I don’t think he does. I see two kinds of people who don’t believe in god. Those are the ones who ignore religion and go for the science and there are the ones who can’t believe in him cause they don’t want to think that there is this great thing that can prevent all those torturous events from happening to them but just lets it happen. And I am sorry if you don’t get why I can’t believe in the all mighty. But the thing is (and this might be the worst thing i could ever say) I don’t want to believe in god cause whenever I have these mental breakdowns just crying in solitude or getting beaten up by my dad or hurting myself which I don’t really know why, I blame him (god) for putting me in this position when the Bible tells you that he can get you out of anything. I sit there alone, sacred and bruised physically, mentally and emotionally then I say ‘I hate you for doing this to me’ but then I immediately feel guilty and then start to loath myself even more. And then I ask, why didn’t he get me out of this one? Did I really deserve it? Or am I just talking to thin air? If there is really someone out there why does he let us go through all this scaring events just to let him decide wether we are good enough to go to heaven or break at some point and go to hell? And maybe things just happen for no reason and will keep happening that way and people would make a big deal out of everything. But for me the truth has always been dark. And it takes a dark one to understand that and live by it. Even if it means I will never experience real affection with anyone maybe I will get a chance to change that in my next life or maybe I will vanish into nothing and I would be ok with both cause nothing happens for a reason, no one is special, we are all going to die.

First time  venting here..ive graduated recently. Tried to be and do good wherever I go. During late part of my university school year, I met a girl and was with her as a friend. Yes this is another girl vent story. But I got no one to talk to. 
 Then I told her everything abt myself and she did too. And before I knew it we started kissing and doing stuff. No sex tho. And I didn't want to do those things. I wasn't sure I had feelings for her. But she put me first and treated me very nicely. And me not being able to do that, it killed me.  And it was not fair. I told her I didn't want to be like this. And then, when she cried I felt bad and I told her that I'll try to love her and be like how she wanted me to be. Then i tried but I keep letting her down. After going through this road repeatedly, we both tried to maintain our friendship status. Then after graduating and starting work far from home, I met another girl. She was nice to me like so nice. She takes me to her home and I was so amazed how some ppl could be so good. I shouldve been suspicious back then. All of a sudden she tried kissing me one time and I dogded her. But then she was so mad. Then on another day, I kissed her. Then she was so happy. After someday, we started making out and having sex menamen. I lost my virginity then. I was so sad. Because I let my God and myself down. For one, I didn't know this new girl well. I'm not married. My dream was to keep my virginity till marriage. My dream was to marry in church with crown on my head. It was a big deal to me. Becha, I went down this road for 3 months and this new girl told me it is wrong doing these things. That we should be friends. I mean she was right. She realized this after she had a car accident. And she feared that she was going to die doing bad things. I mean, she was right. Then I agreed. But then after some time, she started sneaking out and going somewhere else. I asked her where have u been menamen? But she doesn't tell me. The girl who used to tell me everything, who was open to me when she talks started going dark on me. And I was so bored at night. Because she used to talk to me. I mean I admit I miss the kissing part but the hurtful part is, her going dark on me. I tried to tell her but she had ways with words and me I'm awful with that. And before I know it our conversation ends up at a dead end. After another 3 months, she tells me that she met a married guy. She met him on work. And he wanted to thank her for the service she has given him. Why go at night and why on everyday basis, ill never know. Becha, she told me. By then she also met another person who was recently assigned to where we work. She received him well just like she did with me. When we eat together, they started 'megoraresing' eachother in front of me.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9585580825805664

Hi 
First time venting. Me and my brothers used to live with my mom since my parents are separated. Then my dad took us saying "" i love u and i want u to know me more"" we started living with him when i was grade 10 its been 4 yrs since then. When we went to dad's house my life changed he was not the person he said he is. My grades fall hard and couldn't recover, i lose confidence, started loosing my temper easily........now after i came back from University my parents had a huge fight again so we ( me and my brother's) have to choose where there is one or two people as a witness from the begining we never wanted to live with him so its easy to choose but the problem is if we choose mom there will be no financial aid from him which makes it hard but we will get our  happiness back and if we choose dad there will be no problem with money but our life esp my bro's will be full of darkness.
Just wanted to let that out.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9971548318862915

I'm a university student..,to start off i'm not a very emotional or dependent kind of person but  I met my boyfriend on my first days of freshman year.. so it's always been him&I ever since. We were so close that we used to do everything together like literally. But the problem is that he graduated this year and i still have 2more years to go. We were really looking forward for him to stay at campus and be a lecturer but the test didn't go as planned. So now the thought of me being there with out him scares me to death. I don't have friends(not so good at getting along with girls. Not even my dorm mate's),most of my friends i used to hangout with besides him were his friends  (all graduated with him). So i'm pretty much a mess right now. I can't tell him because he'll just worry too much. I'm dying inside and don't know what to do.

Ever had a month, a week, or even just a day of a series of bad things happening? Well I'm having a year of that! My year of unfortunate events. I always look for a way to look at the bright side of things, the good in people n the good stuff in life but after about a year of this endless cycle of bad things happening one after the other I've had it! Ive always been grateful for all the good things and avoided complaining about shit I can't fix and always found something to look forward to, but now.. I'm fucking sick of it! Thinking ""shit could get worse,"" and just sucking it up n moving on? I've done that enough times to know that sometimes it's just not enough. Don't always hold it in.. let it go sometimes.. bitch about the shit that's bothering you when u feel the need to cause seriously those who mind, don't matter n those who matter, don't mind..

I have been on and off with relationships. My previous boyfriend went to another state for good after 8 months of relationship. I was so broken cause we were doing so well!I know 8 months isn't long but I swear it felt like 8 years to me. So perfect like in the movies. After that happened I was back to being single until my best friend introduced me to her friend. She said I need to get my head back in the game. so anyway, we started talking and hanging out. Then one day he asked me to be his girlfriend and I agreed. So we were labeled as a couple. I don't know y'all. I am so confused.. I am in a situation where I want and don't want him. I'm a bit of an anti social so I don't really have much friends.. he was one. He comforted me whenever I felt alone. I was so broken and he told me he would be there for me and help me in the healing process but then after I read this guy talking about how he felt pity for his girlfriend because her life was fucked up so thats why he was dating her out of pity,  I wondered is my boyfriend doing that? does he feel pity for me?

What is sad is the fact that young guys and some older ones actually believe that a womans going to get loose down there if she has alot of sex. Its not true. Hell you can even exercise it after you have a kid to get it tight again. A woman's vagina can withstand having multiple babies, being stretched out and returning to its natural shape and men honestly think their bald 4 inches is doing ANYTHING  not forgetting the fact vaginas are essentially made of muscle, the more you USE a muscle the stronger it will get.

This for all people who have sucidal thoughts or just want to make it all stop.. 
Am a girl in my early 20's who not only had suicidal thoughts but tried to actually do it and failed in atleast 2 different occasions when i was a senior in elementary school and in my junior yrs in high school and i have also met alot of people in campus with the same experience and all i can tell you is that watever the reason is that is making u have this thoughts ignore it for one day and then one more day and another day just sleep it off or do anything to let that moment pass cause trust me when u hit ur 20's all those moments will make u laugh at ur self cause even if time doesn't heal u will realize those things weren't actually that big of a deal or that there was a misunderstanding or that u staying alife will have such a huge effect on the life of the people around u. So stay strong and keep being you.. and if u want any advice or just someone talk to drop ur usernames and i will make sure to reach out",amusement,NEGATIVE,0.9897263646125793

Hey... so here it goes. 
I have been slacking on my religion lately and I did it on purpose. See I was trying to be a devoted Christian going to church and all but I just couldn't stop sinning at all. I tried my fear of Hell to motivate me to stop but that didn't work out so again I used my love for God but that didn't work out either. I guess I didn't love God enough to stop sinning. Also I tried to ask myself would God like this? before I do something but I that felt oddly wrong to me cos I like doing those things. And I thought that shouldn't be the way to worship. I should stop sinning not bc I don't wanna go to Hell but bc I value God's word over my meaningless actions. So I stopped caring for my actions and do them without any second thoughts. And believe me that didnt felt good at all. I sinned like crazy but I didn't feel any remorse what so ever. There was just this voice in the back of my head telling me how far I've gotten from where I have been. However I chose to ignore it. But today I woke up and realized that I'm nowhere near the place I wanted myself to be. I'm nowhere close to the person I wanted to be and I feel worse than before. Now this is frustrating me a lot and I don't know what to do. I'm concerned about myself and how I'm gonna end up. Its just stressful to know that you chose the road you thought was the right but end up in a completely different place that is worse than before. I dont know what I'm doing or what I wrote gn people please tell me something that will be helpful for my concern.

Thank you and sorry for the long vent.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9969125986099243

Hey everyone
I'm an 18 years old girl, and there is a guy that I have started liking for a while now. He is a very wise , generous,  humble, sweet and understanding. He also has sth that I really like...challenging people_ he proves his point and challenge me to do my Best and he doesn't give it up just to make me happy. Well sometimes he does, but not like the too caring guys. He changed the way I think about a lot of things. He healed my painful scars without knowing that he did. He made me happy without trying to impress me. And i so am thankful for that. And now I guess I'm growing to like him.
So here's the problem, last time I made the ""first move"", it didnt turn out so well. And i have suffered a lot and gave up untill this guy came. He doesn't seem to like me the way I do tho, and as days go by...I'm getting scared even more.
I have lost a lot of friends in my life....the people I love don't seem to love me back the way I do. So what am I supposed to do now? 
I don't want to loose him...but I want our relationship to evolve too.
So should I drop this whole thing and just be a friend...or do u say I should keep trying and see what happens?",love,NEGATIVE,0.954474687576294

So hey guys. Well my parents had problems in their relationship and because of that I grew up believing love didn't exist. Its not just them its everyone around me. All the people I've seen in a relationship have all been hurt so they have disproved the theory of love for me. It just doesn't exist for me. So I vowed to my self to love as little as possible so as not to get hurt. Then one day I started to text this guy and, well, I don't know how to explain it but well, we just clicked. And he brought my walls down all around me. I fell in love with him. And when I say love I don't mean the romantic way. I just mean love like the unexplainable kind. Like he just makes me happy in a way like I haven't felt in a long time. It just hurts. The realization that I have fallen hurts. How can I make it stop. How can I stop the pain?

I’ve been in love with a friend of mine whom I knew for the past 4 years. She is incredibly smart and never cease to amaze me. I love how passionate she is to her dream and vision and that’s what makes me fall in love with her more and more. We first met when we were  in Addis. I wanted to tell her what I was feeling but we finished our project there and we couldnt stay in touch. 1 year later we met in Finland while she was studying her Masters and I was visiting some friends/business meeting. She was dating her classmate at that time so I couldnt say a word. Gradually I started to grow some fear that she has higher standards and I’d break her heart. Funnily enough, We met again a year later in some conference in Hong Kong while she was fundrasing for her startup and I was there to visit the conference. Again, she was very stressed and busy at the moment so I just tried to help with her presentations and stuff,, so yeah… 

Two years later (Now) we’re in Addis, working on some project in the same company — and she’s dating some guy. My friends tell me I should just go for it since we’ve seen the guy playing around abroad and they know him well, also suspect she also knows that but she chose to ignore it.

The choices you have made and the hard work you have put in all this while have led you to this point in time and place; you are now ready to embrace even the more tough and strenuous life that awaits you ahead. In the art of metallurgy to get the gold, one must dig into the overlying dirt and in your journey of finding yourself, you have fought, fallen, risen and now you see an opportunity to take a leap and make a significant score.",admiration,POSITIVE,0.999372661113739

He cheated so I heard so I told him, I ended it, maybe it is my pride but he never appologized not a single word as if I meant nothing,he just let it be ,now I am left here feeling cheap, hurt and ashamed.

Not a vent but much of an advice to sisters out there struggling with knowing wt u deserve,, hope it's helpful..
If a man doesn't call u it's bc he doesn't want to call u. If he doesn't invite u to go out it's bc he doesn't want to see you. If he treats u like shit it's bc he doesn't care. If he let's u go, it's bc he doesn't want to be with u. When a man says ""I'm not ready, but ur the love of my life and the only one I want, but now is not the right time. "" it's simply bc he doesn't want u, don't play his confusing games. Don't justify him. When a man wants to be with a woman, he stays with her without lies, excuses and complications. Stop being genuine and naive, and stop justifying his every excuse and complications and put urself first. 
You DO NOT need someone who doesn't know wt they want, you DO NOT need someone doesn't know ur worth. You deserve a man that knows ur worth and fight for u everyday. 
Stop breaking ur heart from someone who probably won't even be as good as u expect and give urself the opportunity to be happy and be with someone who actually deserves YOU.

Is this rock bottom. I laugh at the dreams I used to have ..I had these big dreams and i never became one of them..that line from the pursiut of happiness haunts me. Tho when I saw it I didnt think much of it. now at this moment it is feeling more like a prophecy. Have you ever woken up with your chest so tight your breathing shallow becuse you can no longer see your future. A future you were once excited about..a future that kept you warm during cold nights. when eveything starts spinning and I can't hold on. I think maybe there is a reason to all this maybe there is some bigger plan at work. I smile remembering the days I used to pray everyday for my family. I have fallen so much I don't think my past self would even recognize me.A family I once loved now I can't face because i am  ashamed at who I have become. Am I sparing them by hiding  the person I am or am I sparing my self. I think maybe if  don't tell them at least in thier eyes thier perfect little child lives on that gives me a little comfort.i can't look past tommorw becuse all i see is what is no more and never will be. so what is the point of it all if everytime I keep sinking  to newer depths. so far from light that my eyes have come to see in the dark.

It is my first time venting.  whenever things get serious and I really need to say what I feel or if I get mad even if its something silly, my eyes fill with tears.  Usually someone asks why my eyes shed tears. Someone asking whats wrong makes it worse, it  makes me  start weeping.  I dont have any control over it. So when I cry people think I am weak, or that I am really hurt. Always trying to cover up my tears I dont say what is in my mind. 
This is being a big problem in my life for a long time. I have had a lot of embarrassing moments because I couldnt control my tears. Recently, I have cried trying to convince my boss in a topic related to work. She was completly shocked  because it was not a situation anyone  could be senstive on.

Something u guys don't understand is that last year they(some youth group from mekelle) tried to attack and u'd peobably remember if u were there last year 1st semester. It was horrible. I don't blame them, they're people they get mad whenever they hear something bad happening to the tigrains living in other region. So the only way to get revenge is to get back to us living there.

Well...this is only a fraction of what the problem is... shit is that they both get mad at you for thinking you sided with the other. You have no idea! Ahunema yerasachew guday iyalku new. I'm suppose to be mature...well at this age but I still feel like i'm not mature enough, my parents are too busy blaming me for their problems, too busy looking for reasons to tell me i'm chossing sides that I don't think they even care anymore. They'ye falling expecting me to pick them up everytime, they forget that i'm human too. What happened to ""things won't change, we will still love you the same"". I maybe sound like a spoiled child neger but i've been trough a lot cuz of them..missed out on a lot of things normal people shouldn't. I have tried to jelp them, I really did. After all they are my parents and i still do love them but i'm not goanna chase after them anymore i've wasted almost half my life doing that. I'm sick, sick and tired of convincing them that I didn't say or do the bullshit they claim I did. Well... a fraction of my problems is this.. the rest i'd rather not think bout. That's what I want to stop thinking, I hate this. They bring me down and if I try to redeem myself i'm selfish but if I don't it's still somehow my fault

I just gotta say this out loud. I miss you. I am the kind of person that says what he feels but this time I can’t. But I do. I really do. I miss our talks, your jokes, and the nicknames u got me that no one else in the world uses. I am not saying I want us to be more. Or that I want to kiss u again and wait for it to rain but I wish this had never happened and we were friends once again. I wish I met u for the first time today and I do everything right so things wouldn’t be as complicated. I wish I could just txt u now n ask how u r doing or just talk about anything really. But it’s just like last time, things I do to fix things right, gets us to end up with moments we can’t get over. I hope you are ok. I hope our brief friendship meant a great deal to u like it did to me. I am sorry we couldn’t be more, I am sorry I ruined what we had. I didn’t mean for all of this to happen. It’s time that got us here and it’s time that will heal. I know what u r thinking. That am always keeping it together but I am not. I am not ok. I lost my close friend.

Thank God. I finally got over you. I know you love me and you did nothing wrong. It was me. I took a peek in to the future, beyond the blinding cloud of love, in to the reality and saw tears and broken hearts. I know you can't see it from here where everything seems so easy and you think what really matters is the fact that we love eachother to death. That's not true. I've seen people change. They change so much that they would even forget why they thought everything would workout in the first place. So I decided for both of us. It wasn't as easy as I pretended it was. I cried myself to sleep all those years and the pain I went through, only God knows. Ignoring your calls, moving away to a different city, the tought of not having you in my life and forgeting about you was like ultimate death to me. there were times I thought of ending my life. I did it for us. My friend called today. she told me she fell in love. I was not jealous and I was not longing for you. My day was not ruined thinking about you in sadness. I hope you feel the same.

I just wanted to share a piece of mind that I’ve learned and I’m still comprehending. 
After a breakup with an ex or an almost lover, we all go into a pit. We feel emotions that we have never felt before and we start missing them. What I’m here to say is that missing ur ex or ur crush or that person after a breakup doesn’t mean you’re in love with them. It doesn’t mean that u want them. U were attached to them, attached to talking to them everyday or seeing them so often, attached to the names they were calling u and when u end that attachment, of course it’s gonna feel like the end of the world. And u want nothing but to crawl back to them. It’s always hard letting go of what you’re used to and u thought was ur future. But it’s only days or maybe months until u get over them. Life goes on and time heals everything. Keep ya head up high.",neutral,POSITIVE,0.9778302311897278

So I just want to thank you for breaking my heart. If you hadn’t, I wouldn’t know what it’s like to hit rock bottom and then pick myself up from there. If I didn’t know how it feels to reach my lowest point, I wouldn’t fully understand how strong I am and how much resilience I possess. Thank you for breaking off our relationship because now I know that I am worth so much more than what you were willing to give me. Know I can see what I want in a man and what I don’t want. I will look for someone who truly comprehends how special I am and someone who values me way more than you ever did.
Thank you for crushing me. Now I realize that I had lost myself in you. Now I can focus on getting myself back to the incredible and single person I was before I was even been in a relationship. Thank you for making me see the beauty in this breakdown. There was magnificence and poetry in the pain I experienced. Thank you for helping me explore my artistic outlets.

Some...some of us here talking about our feeling, thought or ""venting""
Won't help, can't help!
Some of us here are just too fucked up and broken to let alone be okay but even have the chance to be better
Some extremely sad the they are at the next level of null literally not giving a damn if everything burns right now or Earth cracks open
Some..so hurt they gave up on GOD, Parents , Friends everything... nothing makes sense anymore
Some of us here are damaged beyond repair
Peffing and going ""you haven't seen shit"" when someone says stuff

Granted i've talked to guys before but that normally ended after a couple of weeks, because shortly they would find out that i wasn't giving them what they wanted.and i was perfectly fine with them walking away but HE was different which was what pulled me in even more . i developed some hard feelings for this guy,and i had no control of it like everday we texted non stop and it felt awsome   to feel special like that turns out we had a lot in common as well . in the beginning , i had really hard time believing that he was actually intersted in me he was sweet, smart, and honest blah blah blah..all all disrable qualities i wanted in a boyfriend hmmm things change like i was pretty stupid.but i just couldn't face the fact that he was like all other lovely guys i have been fortunate to cross paths with. Even though i was stupid i still broke down crying and sobbed for a while but eventually i wiped my tears and realized how ridiculous i was being.bkaaaa he lying basically bout everything. I've always wanted someone who is honest with me but he showed me anyone can lie over everything he made me to realize that I shouldn't spend so much time getting to know through social media or textinghe showed me what I don't deserve in s guy .i've always known what I deserved ,but I was too scared to go out and find a guy who would treat me the way I should be treated cause I still have feelings for him",sadness,POSITIVE,0.8354042172431946

What more can a girl want more than a guy who loves her? Why is it not enough? I want to love you. I’m trying to love you but no matter how bad I want to fall for you, it just never works. I know you would do anything for me. You would give me the world if I asked for it. I have never met anyone who cared this much about me and I didn’t know it was possible to be loved like this until I met you. But I can never return the feeling no matter how desperately I want to. I care about you but I’m not in love with you. And everyday I feel like I’m betraying you by being with you when I don’t feel the same. I know you deserve so much more. And so I think about letting you go but I’m addicted to the love you give me. I love how you love me. Damn, am I selfish for keeping you.

Okay so she dated her best friend for about a year right? And then because of something personal they couldn't continue but they remained best friends. So now he asks her constantly to send him nudes. She tried to ignore it as much as she can and she didn't tell him to fuck off cause they are pretty tight and have a lotta history together. She thought it would ruin their friendship and ish. Now she is asking me what she should say to him. I have no advice for her. Rather speechless.

Is it normal to be 19 years old, a college undergrad student, a bit socially awkward, an introvert, that has a sad life with a bunch of friends,but not really a close friend.... And Not Have A Single Fucking Crush her entire life???? Fantasies many, but not really a crush.. I mean is it normal to be like that.. Being asked on dates a bunch of times but turned them down because I believe 19 is a young age for dating.. Not really felt like an attraction to a normal human-male... And always seen myself living alone.. With my family whom I love so much.. For the rest of my life.. I mean I have passed this fire age phase like a dull creature that hasn't got the ability to be attracted to a guy.. I mean is it normal.. 
I need help.. 
Feel free to mock me, I know I do..
And please don't say 19 is not a young age.. Because it is.. Its the time of a young humans life where they learn  and make their life's in order so that they can be ready for a partner.. But still if u want to object.. Feel free..

So my gf and I decided to celebrate our 1 year anniversary (since we started dating) in a fancy way sooo I planned out the perfect night...nice dinner, go out and party, the back to a fancy hotel room for some ""work"". 
So Every thing went according to plan until we go into the room....the vibe was emotional, intimate, very very sexual....so when I got ""downstairs"" I've never seen anything like it before....her clit is soooo big that it looks like a fucking dick...wtf like I'm the only one that has to have a dick in this rlshp eko. So after that encounter I stopped immediately and went to the bathroom to gather my thoughts..so I came up with a lame ass excuse and told her I was sick from the dinner we ate and that I have to sleep on it menamen...

Ever since that day I'm trying to sabotage my rlshp with her bc I rly can't be with her sexually..it's just impossible even though she's an amazing girl

Hello there.
I think I have a problem. Every time I fall for a girl I ended up hurt. The most hurt i got was about couple of months ago. Let me tell you that story. I saw a girl in class and I thought she was the one, from the moment I saw her I fall for her. I was best friends for her for about 1 & half years. Then I told her about my feelings and she declined me down because she had a complicated past. Then I asked her one last time and we decided to be with each other. We had some fun times. Suddenly we broke up. And that's when I realized that a person can get hurt that much. Then I hit my rock bottom, I stared doing some fucked up shit. So my point is I fall for the girls that ain't right for me and get hurt. And I think I will do it again so what the hell should I do. I just saw I may worst place I don't want to get back to it again it's fucked up.

Mine is a little bit different issue. I have a girlfriend. More like fiancé. cause I am sure am gonna marry her No matter what. So she is perfect. Very curvy, very pretty, very modest becha she betam konjo and tsebayegna.
The problem is I love her too much that I couldn't longer hold it in. I express it every second. First we have rule( actually only my rule which I set up while she didn't agree) we have to see each other daily beyatalw. And even after work I will go to her hood just to see her. I will be around their gate and call her then she will come out with them pyjamas and I will just stare at her and will say good bye. Loving someone is blessing I know. But mine is too much. And the problem is I show it all am very clingy of her. And all this is affecting my social life. Like ke sera sweta my friends na shay buna enbel mnamn silugn No I got a lotta stuff to do minamn elchewalew while everyone at work knows where I ride my car. Its always the place where she is.
I didn't know anyone could love this much. God! I couldn't sleep at night just thinking about in what position she is sleeping iko!!
I swear to God for happiness I would kill all my family. Esuan des kalat rasenm new matfalat.
I usually purposely leave my car to be with her a little more. Like taxi sasafrat and walk sendareg I will have plenty time to spend with her bemilew. I don't really care if she loves me as much as I do which is obvious she don't. Enem I don't wanna decrease the love I have for her but at least I should stop showing it. I know I will marry her malet ahun work out sayadreg lela sew betageba for sure I will kill him and marry her again. Like am dead sure. Gin ahun esu adlem issue gin tell me how could I stop showing this too much love for her.

There are a lot of girls that occasionally hit me up and I ask them for pictures of them (the ones I like with bewbs, ass and lots of dat vagene, lol) they always oblige. I even had some sex with a couple of them. And I don't wanna stop receiving this pictures from the ladies.I like them types of pictures. They excite and give me adrenaline.

Hi guys its my first time venting  am a girl and  I had this  huge crush on a guy for like 3 years without him  knowing he friendzoned me and he would tell me about his Girl , how much he loves her ... Etc and it hurted like hell. Fast forward he knew what I felt and we got together  and he made me the happiest I've ever been and hurted me like hell too. He was a very nice guy not a player shit but he hurt me so bad . When we first broke up it was unbearable I was so hurt I never taught I will make it through.  He  would humiliate me, step on my pride, ignore me, call me names and still act like he the victim.  A month after we broke up I heard he is with someone else already .It's been 2yrs now and I still can't get over him I tried dating other people but its  either because they look like him or cause my friends are pushing me  I still care about him I can't go a day without looking at him. I would switch acc to see his post and it really  sucks please can u tell me how to forget someone who hurts u so much

Okay, here is my problem. I am 21 years old female. I am senior in college and will graduate in 6month. I’ve never been outside of what my parents commands and do all they asked but I don’t feel like they give me freedom. Whenever I go out they wanna know where I am going, who I am meeting, what we will do etc... for instance if I go out partying, which they won’t allow me to btw, they think the next step I will take is drop out of college and then live a wasted life. But They haven’t helped me with my school. I got scholarships for myself. Everything paid for and I made descions for my self. I am mature enough to know that I have a goal and nothing will come in my way of me achieving my goal. But if I go out and am a little late they they think I’m out wilding and doing crazy things, which I absolutely don’t do. what made me realize that  it was too much is when some of my friends and even some family members told me that it’s not appropriate question to ask for my age.

Besides my family. My bestfriends are all I have. And I love them. But this summer has basically made all of us busy. Most of them got gfs and bfs. And that makes me...*drum roll* the third wheel. But ofcourse I really didn't mind that (actually I did). I liked this boy anyway, just didn't know how to tell him. Fast forwarding, I told the boy. It was probably the first and last time I'm ever gonna do that cause it didn't end well. I tired to talk to my friends about it, but they always talking about how they are so madly in love it seems like I was kinda out of the picture.  So I just kept it to myself hoping something would change things for me. I tried to move on and like other people. But my thoughts always end up revolving around him. I'm never ussualy like this you know. Me and him still talk, but its as if I never told him. As if my feelings never meant anything.

Listen, there's is this girl I know in church. She's perfect. She's the type of girl that every guy would kill for. She fascinates me out of all girls I knew I don't fantasize having sex with her. I fantasize holding her in my arm, gaze in her eyes, cuddle in bed while it's raining, linger into her eyes until our heart beat sync. God I'm in love. But now she left this country and now she's in DC. I'm going there maybe next year or after next year. But I'm scared might lose her. I mean there was a time she holded my hand while we were watching Christopher Robins in the cinema. We looked at each other for like 15 seconds and we were abt to kiss until her sister took her in a rush. I tried to call her but she wouldn't answer. So she called me in the after 2 days with a US number and she told me she left. I swear to God I cried. I never cried like that in my life. Its like my heart got decapitated and even though she hurt me I'm still hoping I'd see her again but I get worried if she already started a relationship. We text like everyday. After I told her I might be there she was hooked and happy but I don't know for how long. Should I move on? I mean, I'm truly in love with her.",fear,POSITIVE,0.9954692125320435

Men.
They spend a good part of their life trying to woo the girl they like, but end up being friendzoned. Sometimes, they don't even tell about their feelings because it would hurt us. They take us out on dates and movies, even when they don't have enough money to buy themselves a shirt. They change themselves to be the best guy they can be, just to make us happy. Once they are in love, there is no turning back, they will always love you no matter what. At times, they give up on their (lesser paying) dreams because they have the responsibility of a family. They make sure you're on the safer side of the road. They leave the last piece for you.
As women are under scrutiny all the time, Men are laden with expectations. They are expected to get better marks to get a job, then expected to get a better job for high pay because they are expected to be the bread-earners, they are expected to be physically stronger than the women around, not to mention they can’t cry their hearts out. They are expected to be better drivers and to know directions. Once married, they are expected to make enough money to take care of their family, and what not. They also get hurt. They also breakdown. They have their mood swings too. They feel insecure about their bodies too. They listen to your problems, but keep their problems within themselves most of the times. How often have you heard your dad complaining or crying about things?

Women
 I see men calling women sluts bitches and hoes and it hurts for one thing they dnt deserve it at all and for a second they make us guys look bad
Its though on women they have to struggle through a primitive backward society who thinks they are not equal to men they are forced to act a certain way, be passive  or  they will intimidate men  
I mean we men never have to deal with some of the shit they. Have to..including something as hard and as painfull as giving birth
They over think whether a guy likes them or not whether we guys are really saying what we mean and I dnt blame them bcoz they are frequently let down disappointed and heart broken by the ppl they hold dear

  so nxt times u men call a girl by a name remember that your mom or sister or aunt ur insulting....

Instead of being a channel i can use as a shoulder to cry on to it has become something, something so different and so judgmental. I cant tell people my problems and expect advice because most of you just want to insult others as if you are a saint, i think judging people makes you feel better about yourselves. if it does, dont forget we are all going to hell, it is just how it is, in this generation i dont think  there is anyone who hasn't sinned, and ya'll are in your high horses looking down and judging people like u aint done shit (at least they admitted it and are asking for help) and news flash judging is another sin 
And about the LGBTQ community:- commenters, you are not being asked to comment on your status or if you want to be gay or a lesbian the venters are just ""VENTING"" that is literally the point of the channel. But if you have the absolute urge to comment why dont you comment smthing like ""that is a sin"" or "" Ethiopia doesnt accept stuff like this""  or "" the bible said .....""
You dont have to call them mean words and to go die they are human too, they feel like us 
And to the girl who cheated:- first of all commenters..WTF i haven't seen so much hate in a while what is wrong with you koy it isn't mandatory to comment eko you can just say nothing

To all the people against the LGBTQ+ , I Just want to say something. LGBTQ+ is not for you to accept or reject. It's not for you to judge. If you don't like them it's cool. I mean i have kinds of people i don't like too, you know like people who do plastic surgery solely for cosmetic purposes. I don't like it but u know what? That stuff is not about me. Regardless of people going plastic, my life has not been altered in anyway. Its the same situation here, those ppl loving each other has not hurt me or you in anyway. So really whatever you do to try to stop them is basically a witch hunt. You can infect them with HIV all u want. But they'll always be here just like how us straights will always be here. And as long as they're here, they'll fight to be able to exercise one of their basic human rights. Yes, you read it right it's one of their basic human rights. And if history has taught us anything, these people are going to openly express themselves one day. just like how black people were not considered human and got enslaved, just like how women weren't allowed to work outside the house, and just like every other right that had been suppressed in the history humanity. These people will also overcome. You best believe that.

 also people who are really religious who find this as something that couldn't change
Don't hate this commenters  they are giving you a good advice

You should Google the LGBTQ right in Ethiopia 97% didn't accept it up to 15 year imprisonment (much more years than killing someone here )

It's not an easy thing falling for someone , it takes time and courage to that take that  leap , and am not saying it's some kind of crush , where you say damn she's hot or he is hot and obssess about how they are in bed , falling for someone is the pain you feel when you are not around them , it's the constant joy they bring you for just being alive and breathing , it's the enjoying and accepting of every flaw they have , but falling for someone can be a a huge , changing mistake to , you would think ""hey "" their out searching for love right , but I love them so they'll be mine , it makes perfect sense to basics of it all , but when you love a person who doesn't understand it , which is almost everyone lately it starts to change you for the worst , make you loose sight of what you were , makes you even forget happiness , since all everybody wants what they can't have , reaching towards a fantasy , hurting and playing with the people that actually do love them , it's a never ending cycle of misery and stupidity , what happend to the good old romance them if you like them and they'll love you on how you end up treating , why the lies , the envy the need to make everyone else feel shitty about their lives for them to see you shine , where being a golddigger is considered the why to be , where having multiple guy friends in the freindzone is considered a skill where trying to fuck a girl just cause she has numerous Instagram followers so can brag to your friends , it's disheartening to see what it all has come to , don't get me wrong I understand it's something that came with the generation and you'd be a fool if you didn't adapt , well fuck adapting if it means you don't even know the person your being pathetic for cause they are just showing you what they think you'll like so it can put them on top their non exsisting social hierarchy its tragic really",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9546979069709778

Okay so am just one more person. Listen if u want to or whatever..
So it's a question; if u saw people in a building and it was on fire would u tell them to get Out? If u knew a food was poisonous and u told someone not to eat it are u judging them? If u knew there was a bomb set on a gate and the house owner didn't know, would u tell them? 
Then why is it wrong to tell people who are gay or lesbian they r in the wrong. Am not supporting insults cuz that won't help anything. But telling them it ain't okay shouldn't be frowned up on. We say it cuz we care. If ur moma was in a house that would explode, won't u drag her out of it? Then why not here? It's the same. Just cuz they ain't relatives should we not care? Should we not warn? Should we not speak the truth? So all y'all saying it's okay this is for u. Ur telling them drinking poison is okay cuz u will die by ur self. And for those who say; there are other sins so this shouldn't be frowned on, well guess what buddy UR WRONG. Instead of telling the others, ur saying it ain't only him whose gonna die so let them all die together. Let them explode, evaporate and go to hell together. Which IS NOT RIGHT. It doesn't make it right. That's a stupid theory. There is something called SIN and there is a HELL which is eternal. U can't kill urself out of there u can't ever leave. No time limit set like the current world. So if ur telling me that warning a person they r on a path to hell is wrong then so be it. Cuz I ain't gonna watch when people dance their way to eternal fire. Cuz I care. I don't judge, hell I ain't even perfect enuf. But am trying. They should too. Look to the one that can help them cuz no it is NOT natural. So sorry for CARING but I won't change cuz of democracy I won't stop caring because of equality rights. They r humans, they deserve to be loved and cared for and they have rights too. But it is WRONG so they should change their paths.

To the venter above claiming to 'care' since they're saving the 'sinners' from hell by telling them they shouldn't do what they WANT to do. What they FEEL is right.  What they NEED TO ACCEPT ABOUT THEMSELVES. Do not even dare bring religion into this. You are a hypocrite of the highest magnitude. You don't like sin? 
Well, Guess What
If you wear ripped jeans, you're going to burn.

Leviticus 10:6 “Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people.”

Oh, yeah. You also can't wear mixed cloth, bitch.

Leviticus 19:19 “Neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.”

No short haircuts

Leviticus 19:27 “Ye shall not round the corners of your heads.”

Beard required

Leviticus 19:27 “Neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.”

That tat of a cross isn't getting you extra credit, Johnny.

Leviticus 19:28 “Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the Lord.”

Don't put two seeds in the same crop, 'cause it's an abomination...for some reason.

Leviticus 19:19 “Thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed.”

That mixed-breed dog you have? Yeah...that'll grant you a one way ticket to hell, too.

Leviticus 19:19 “Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind.”

No grudge-holding!

Leviticus 19:18 “Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people.”

Touch a dirty puppy? BURN!

Leviticus 5:2 “If a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.”

Wait...so less church is good?

Leviticus 12:4–5 “And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.”

No manual labor on Saturdays.

Leviticus 23:3 “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.”

No going to church after birth.

Leviticus 12:2 ""Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.""


Pull out=die

Genesis 38:9-10 ""Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother. But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the Lord; so He took his life also.""

No divorce

Mark 10:9 ""What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.""

No jewelry

Timothy 2:9 ""Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments.""

If someone's attacking you, you can't grab your attacker's privates.

Deuteronomy 25:11-25:12 ""If two men, a man and his countryman, are struggling together, and the wife of one comes near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who is striking him, and puts out her hand and seizes his genitals, then you shall cut off her hand; you shall not show pity.""

Hello unihorse

I rather say i wanted to say something than vent. so here its 
Why do you think most of us peoples are unhappy why are we so intimidated that bad things will happen to us? you know why, its because we tend to think the negative things than the positives we tend to think the odds we fear i read something earlier about how our mind get used to the thing you think and when ever you start doing something new it always send you the fearfull thoughts and push you to step back  this is totally not our fault its either how we grow up or disastrous things that happened to us before and how we deal with it...but now my point is how can we face our fears ? How can we go for it ? There are lots of books that might  influence you and stuff but I suggest you the best ever method you could use.... its God follow his word do his will you have no idea how peacefull and happy you will be what ever religion you're in ,look deeper in your religion and connect with god your soul will be renewed u'll feel some power inside of you that makes you wash away your fears and work hard, trust me this is the best ever medicen you'll get it worked for me may it work for you

Many of us in this world don’t want to be responsible of our own failures. We always want to blame others for our messed up lives. But that’s not how life works. It really doesn’t matter whose fault it is but it’s our own responsibility to fix it. For example, it is not somebody’s fault if their parents don’t have enough money to get what they need, but it’s their responsibility to overcome that scarcity and build a happy, well organized, and well equipped life for their future. When something is somebody’s fault we want them to suffer, be punished or take responsibility. Again, that’s not how it works especially when it’s your life, your happiness, and your heart which is your responsibility to keep it safe. Unless we are responsible for our life we can’t move forward. When we blame others we stop living in the present and be a prisoner in our past life, we become powerless and hopeless. So to take back your power, to become fearless and start living up to your dreams stop blaming and be responsible of  your own life.",disapproval,NEGATIVE,0.995879054069519

I am not much of a religious man myself but I know a thing or two about the importance of religion. I'm not saying people as individuals need to have a religion of some sort but societies need cultures. From what I know, religion constitutes for the largest part of cultures in most societies. Yes, religion has a downside and yes, millions have died in the name of religion BUT tens or hundreds of millions are alive today because of religion. Strip religion away and we would still have morality and a sense of good and bad, right and wrong but we wouldn't be the same.
Nothing else has been more successful at causing people and organizations to help the needy, to build orphanages, schools, hospitals,..........
Education wouldn't have reached a tenth of it's current progress if it weren't for religion. There wouldn't have been half as many doctors in countries like Ethiopia now if it weren't for religion. Many have recovered from addiction and depression because of religion. Race would have been the single most important identity of people and there would have been more wars in the world if it weren't for religion. Superstitions have stopped wars. Some of the earliest ideals of equality among men were derived from religion.
Religion made people more diverse and more interlinked at the same time. It is a source of comfort, compassion, security, hope and guidance for billions.
So the next time you try to disprove people's faiths, remember, you wouldn't want to take that much away from humanity. In the highly unlikely event of you swaying just the right people to your side, you'll be taking sandals off of the feet of millions of Indian children working in coal mines, you'll be leaving millions of disabled people to fend for themselves.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9135670065879822

There are going to be problems in your lives that are gonna hit you real hard, that you're gonna forget about all this homosexuality. At some point you're gonna realize that there is not much that can be done by you. If you are religious, leave it to God, deep down you know that's what you should do at this point. Otherwise its going to poison your mind to negativity till you start obsessing. 
I'm not sure if most understand this for them but its not a choice. They struggle to not be what they are. They're still human beings though. Its not right or natural. But we can't change them by saying horrible things to them or telling them to die. That's just putting ourselves in another sin.
For now, our country is struggling with a lot of other unspeakable things. Close minded societies are killing innocents and destroying lives because they're blindly following what the people before them blindly believed.

We got to chit chat barely but I doubt he'd remember me at all. He has got many many admirers n lovers (he's a lil famous)  I don't think I even hold his gaze for a second. Many hot girls are throwing themselves at him, Girls who can afford to hangout places he often goes to. I have been suffering for a long time.... Going to places I can't afford just to see him for a little while. I know its foolishness...

“I’ve been with my current boyfriend for almost 8 years, but I
cheated on him when we’d been together for about four years. I
didn't feel like I was getting enough attention from him, and I'd
met this other guy through work. He was willing to give me
attention, and we had this deeply emotional attraction that went
far beyond a physical connection. I stayed at his place one night,
and we made out a lot but didn’t sleep together. He told me he
loved me, and while being doted on is great, it was also a little too
much too soon. I realized I would have been throwing away years
in a solid relationship for this fast-moving thing that was a total
crapshoot. And you know what? That guy got married about two
years after professing his love for me. That fast-paced type of
relationship is not me. Love is built over time, not in a one-night
stand, no matter how deep the emotional connection. I realized
that by jumping into something else, I wouldn't be giving my long-
term relationship a fair chance. After I told him, we decided we
needed to try and figure out our problems. In the end, I don't
regret it because it was a wake-up call for my boyfriend and me
to really figure out what we both needed from each other and
how we could be better. Now, we're both more secure with
ourselves individually, which makes us more secure in our
relationship. I've also realized that our relationship will never be
perfect, and most aren't, so instead of trying to be perfect, we just
have to try to be the best we can for each other.”",realization,NEGATIVE,0.7651215195655823

Hey guys whats up? First of all happy new year. Hope your year is starting out better than the year beforehand . This is my first time venting so i hope i don't get off topic or misspell words and confuse u . I actually have a hypothetical  question for u guys but pleas bear in mind it is a very important  hypothetical  question .
So let us assume there is this girl of age 8 or maybe a year or two younger. And a guy of age 16 or a year or two younger (with 8 years of age difference  with the girl) who is friends with the girls brother and their neighbor. So one day, when this guy comes to her house looking for his friend and ends up finding her alone he SEDUCES her and they end up having sex that day.  but it doesn't  stop at that one day, they do it a couple times again on other days he finds her alone. So the question is, does the girl, once she grew up and realise what she has done, plead rape or just consider it as a consented  sex?  coz even if it was consented, she was wayyy to young for him to knowingly do it with her don't  u think? And pls be sure to explain your answers pls.

Like 11 month,  in the first couple of month we were head over hills for each other,  we would find any possible option to meet up or talk..nd since a month or two ago my feeling for him to decline,  at start when ever he is around I feeling like I really want to be with him but when he is not there I don't feel anything towards him nd now I don't even feeling anything when he is around and I don't feel the same way as I used to nd what makes it worse is that he is falling for me more and I act like am too when he is around cause I don't want him to get hurt,  he is really sensitive and thought of breaking up with me doesn't seem to ever cross his mind,  so what do u guys think I should so,?",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9564406275749207

So I few years back I was in a relationship and I really liked him. My friends never liked him they used to tell me early in the relationship but I ignored it. After a year n half of dating we broke up. We still stayed in touch and all. Its been 2 years since we broke up and after that relationship tho I couldn't really date another dude. Like I've had 3 other guys after him that wanted to date me  but I never felt ready to date n I just push them away.

So...hey all...
I have been trough a lot over the past five years been to a shrink, lost someone and most people ditched me ... so I was depressed at first but I got my shit together I studied and I had a chance to learn in the US- life makes fun of me ye iwnet sometimes I think the gods laugh at me at how foolish I am, how fast I am to hope. Then for reasons I can't talk about my one chance for a better life and a fresh start was taken away from me. The reason I held on for five years, the reason I studied despite all the shit going on in my life I grew stronger. This wasn't suppose to surprise me that ones again I am the joke. I hated life I felt anxious to the point I couldn't function and I even thought about suicide two days passed then I met someone as much as the old me would be disappointed at the now miserable me I fell for him or as my experienced friends told me the idea of being loved by him...oh fml!
Demo I didn't even give time to these foolish things... I was focused on the better future I was going to make happen. I was promised they'd let us go. I didn't even need anyones help I was going to work my way trough college... 

I have had people ask me out before I have been on dates in relationships and never fell for someone the way I did for him I never even knew what falling for someone meant I thought my friends were exagurating it.

You guessed it he broke up with me 
And now I have coping methods that wont keep me occupied and distracted for long.

If you've read this far then you must now I need need need advice 
To get over someone and to ...live I guess
How do you do this?!

Hey y'all...
So these past four months or so were the worst I had in my entire life.. I have a girlfriend, and I love her. Its has been 6 months since we started dating. Throughout these months, we enjoyed each other, had fun and everything. We usually go to clubs, drink, smoke, dance the shit out of us, do everything what a normal teenager does. We also enjoy(very much) our sex life. We normally count dates and use post pills for protection. And this worked all the time... Until about four months back when my gf missed her period. We didn't freak out at first because we both thought its just an irregularity caused by the Hormone pills. But days went on.. And it was about 3 weeks since she missed the period. So finally we decided to go to a local health center and she went a screening test, and was found to be positive. We DIDNOT believe our eyes. We did everything right, at least to our minds... To confirm the lab results we then went to a hospital and she was pregnant, as seen by Ultrasound. I couldn't believe what happened. We're both students, I couldn't imagine what will happen if someone knew about this. I tried to calm myself but I simply couldn't sleep. The next morning I didn't want to wake up to face the reality. We had to terminate the pregnancy, because there is NOway I'm gone be a father at this age. So we've talked about it and went to a hospital, and there we were given options to abort it. We went ahead with the pill and my gf took them. It was one of her worst experiences , as it was soo painful and a lot of blood was lost. After about 5 days she started back her normal life but the bleeding didn't stop. And it kept bleeding for about a month. That was another worry.. At some point I thought I was gone lose her. So we went back to the hospital and they had to manually remove the remnants . After all this she finally stopped bleeding. Now we , both, feel guilty about what we have done. Its very difficult to even see a child after that. And  now, I'm confused if I should discontinue my relationship with her.. On one half she gave up a lot for me and that's difficult to let go, On the other hand I don't want to remember the whole experience and I simply want to quit. What's your idea??",joy,NEGATIVE,0.9947400689125061

Haven't you ever felt like your head is going to explode? So many ideas just rattling around, banging against your skull agian and again, and again. Well that doesn't even cover the half of it. I haven't been through much considering what most of you have gone through but everyones battle's is diffrent. Right now I'm having trouble being faithfull. Ik it may sound harsh but hear me out. I've always had a colorful dating life I've never been tied down for long but I've never had issues with staying faithful either but now something is diffrent. I'm completely infatuated with two girls at the same time, one my gf of a few weeks who's lovable, adorable and everything that I need in my life rn and the other a girl I've known for a while longer but we've been hanging out more and more since my gf is out of town. She's not what you would call ""classically beautiful"" but she's drop dead gorgeous in my eyes and there's just something about the way we connect, I've never had that before with anyone so ik it's more than just lust. The Bottom line is idk what to do, we've been spending a lot of time together alone and it's getting harder to hold my inhibitions. I'm a nice guy, I just want to do the right thing.",admiration,NEGATIVE,0.852910041809082

Ola everyone... I would like to thank you for taking your time to read my problem.
Ummm I'll be sharing you guys what's bothering me a lot these days..currently am computer science student. And I met this guy which is so adorable and caring almost 2 years now . He is 5 years older than me..starting from the day we met we never fought or argued,not even for a sec. We used to text daily..we were like each others journal...we talk about everything...there's nothing we hide from each other..and the saddest and heart breaking part he died due to car accident on new year's eve.. like it killed me a lot literary I wasn't functioning. He was my supporter ..my guidance..I have  faced lot of troubles and hardship in campus and he was the one who stood by me and helped me overcome those challenges.. I never spent a day without texting him or calling him. And now I got no one..knowing the fact that I won't be able to get replies for him breaks my heart. I felt empty..I don't know how I'll lead life without him...I lost my precious brother...best friend just like that...and now I can't see my future me alone without his presence., my friends and my families tells me to forget about him..  he is not that type of person to be forgotten easily. IK we all are going to die and leave this world for good and it was his last day to live but I can't believe he left me so soon. He was only 25. He had lot of plans to achieve.. He's the only thing I see in my dreams and I could  think of..couldn't concentrate on anything. I really need help.. I need to hear you guys opinion; what should I do? I just miss him so so much..I can't put it into words",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.783061146736145

Sometimes I wonder if it would've made a difference to tell you how I feel,that's when I realize that would've been the worst decision ever.I mean look at how you act now whenever I try to warm up to you you make me feel so cheap.I don't even know how people tell me you like me  If this is how people like you treat you I wonder how people who hate you would treat you .I've waited for so long for you to man up and tell me how you feel.Even if you feel nothing I've waited for so long for you to just tell me .But no you'd rather drag me along and act like I'm nothing to you.See all this time I never saw what we had as meaningless.I always thought we had hope.But now,now you've shown me for the millionth time that I mean nothing to you.The difference is this time am done,this time I've realized I was busy watering dead grass,this time I realized you and I are never going to become anything .Not friends.Not more.This time am done.I'm done with your drama,your acts,am done being treated like this.I hope you find  someone who'll meet your needs clearly I wasn't worthy of your attention.Thanks for killing what's left of my self esteem.I hope you have fun.Good bye am done .",gratitude,NEGATIVE,0.9962445497512817

How could you know love if you didn't feel hate.
How do you feel hate if you've never felt love.
They are not two terms that are supposed to be rivals for each other.
They need each other to exist.
Like what is good if there is no bad 
And what is bad if there is no good?
Two terms that are quite opposite of each other but somehow someway they end up being together.
I  guess the point of this all is since they are one you might find one where you might expect the other.
Life is full of surprises and we all need to know what it teaches us.
 So for all that are feeling bad right now be grateful cause once good comes along you know you won't let go.

I don't want to live like this anymore. becuse I have been down this road before and I don't like how it ends. so i will write you out. write you out of me. every word I type thinking about you  now is so far from what I felt when I replied to your texts. At first I was angry. I was angry at you. I didn't think you deserved to be articulated through my words for what you did to me but I realized writing about you is the only way I can feel. The only way I can feel it all.  becuse my days now are  moments of balled up anger and hurt seeping through my walls followed by gaps of numbness where everything is shades of grey. I am not doing this for you becuse I gave myself up for you and that is price enough. No this is for my sanity becuse you don't deserve my time or my energy anymore. so I pour out what is left to these words. then it truly is over for me.

our story atleast my side of it is not tragic or happy. The only word that comes close is ironic. It was ironic. Ironic becuse when I got over her and fell back to my dance of destruction. you came. you came like a soft breath unnoticed. slowly you multiplied and multiplied untill you were all I could think about. and before I knew it I found myself caring. And that scared me so much I tried to push you away but when I heard your cracking voice telling me how much I hurt you. the guilt and pain I felt could have meant only one thing. you were here to stay. I spent many nights agonizing whether I could handle being with you. my head listing  mile long reason why I shouldn't do it yet my heart won every time with just you. I was tierd of fighting. tierd of trying to convince myself you weren't worth it. So I gave up and I gave in. I decided as messed up as I am I can take being more messy for you. I can handle all you would go through. but here is that word again IRONY. I chose us over my self  but you chose  yourself over me. The moment I let my guard down and thought here comes the good part. Baim out of nowhere a suckerpunch. you weren't ready. I could hate you. I could hate him for making you too blind to see I was good for you. but all of that won't fix it. you left and you took all my senses with you. Now everything is the same even the pain has a rhythm to it now. but I can't afford to have you in my head anymore so I trap you in my words and lock you up. with you a part of me goes. a part that believed people could be trusted.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9982376098632812

Trust in God and in your self. Men will always think things that they do in a relationship have nothing to do with God and that no matter how fucked they treat girls that God will turn a blind eye, well karma is a bitch and they will get what's coming to them(probably in some form of a painful ulcer ) so baby girl don't stress don't let a break up put you down.",caring,POSITIVE,0.9860873818397522

What did I ever do to deserve this treatment from you? 
I have only ever cared about and loved you but all you have ever thought about is yourself. Our 'relationship' in whatever form that has taken has been dictated on your terms this whole time and you have  in holding power over me. I have been a toy to you. I'm fun to play with until you get bored and then you discard me and dispose of me like I'm worthless. But it never ends there. A few weeks or months later you remember how fun that game was and you come back to repeat your vicious cycle all over again. And each time I'm broken and discarded the damage on my mind and spirit becomes more irreparable.
But you make me feel as though it's my fault. You twist everything that happens to make it seem like I have let you down and you're the injured martyr. You claim that I have problems and emotional insecurities and this is projected onto me so much I start believing that maybe I do have a problem. And then without a conscious thought I find myself grovelling with apologies, wanting you to forgive me and you throw them back in my face or ignore them coldly with silence.

Fucking shitheads. I'm so sick and tired of you all blaming orormo's for this. You probably got your info from ETV which I'm sure is corrupted so I can't blame you and therefore I apologise for calling you a shithead, but man you've got to understand how pissed off I can be when oromo's are killed everytime and not many news channels cover it or people care about it for that matter but when this one thing (Which is awful and I'm in no way trying to diminish it so DON'T TWIST MY WORD) happens all hell is loose, blame kero. 
KERO BROUGHT THIS FREEDOM FUCKHEADS.

What I'm trying to say to you all is that: I'm sure you're all educated till some level and also are human beings therefore you're all rational beings which distinguishes you from donkeys and pigs so please, yes pleaseeeee don't blame a group of people when you're not well informed about them and also just a tip watch other news channels such as ESAT and just please, I can't say this enough (sigh) DON'T EVER POINT FINGERS AT ANY ONE WHEN YOU'RE NOT 100% SURE. 
I'm going to explain:
When you see a glass filled with sparkling water and someone asks what's in it.. Do you shout ""Ambo""? NO.
Do you shout ""Sprite""? No.
Do you shout ""7up""? No.
You want to know what you do? Well you taste it and maybe taste it somemore or drink the whole glass if that's what it takes, then only then is when you shout out the correct answer.
Simple isn't it.
I hope you understand the metaphor if not I apologise again because I failed you and your still a fuckhead.

Shitheads or fuckheads, I still love you all my fellow Ethiopian's. Let's's respect one another and do all the things our poor Prime Minister is always preaching to us to do. 
Is it only me that feels like crying when I think about him tho? He's trying so hard man... mtssm...

Hello everyone. Ima need everyones opinion on this.

I have had my fair share of relationships where i made the first move and confessed that i liked a girl. Eventually when it doesnt work out, which is mainly because we are young dumb and broke, it always looks like im the one who made the bad decision in the first place and all mistake are pinpointed on me by friends and everyone concerned.

Theres this girl now. Shes real nice, to die for and everyone says shes hella cute. But for once i wanna sense the feeling of a girl expressing her emotions first than me breaking the ice this time around as usual. I'm even planning on waiting out this phase we are going through until she tells me she likes me first. This time i wanna be on the opposite side of the table and know what goes on 'the other side'; when a person actually tells you they like like you for realz and that they'd wanna be with you ketechale forever.

OK no more secrete…. 
I AM DONE AND DONE. I am done for real. I am sick and tired of hiding those feelings inside. Never knew love could go this far. Never knew one could last this long without saying a tiny Minnie thing about it for more than a year. 

FIVE YEARS!!!!!!!!! 

I can’t believe I kept those intriguing thoughts about you for five years. This is insanity. Yea I know maybe I’m too snob to spill the feeling but I’m pretty sure you feel the same too. But why? Why are you trying me out and forcing me to like you more for being hard. 

ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING??????                                                                                            

I bet you’re not. You’re prolly making love with someone you like. Revealing you’re true identity for someone who doesn’t even give a god damn shit like I.
 You made me wait and believe someday you will come to me begging.  Hoo begging ale yagere lj!! chrash As the years pass by your sweetness, easiness, lightness and tenderness strayed like dew gently. And me…I keep following you like a panting dog. 

WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME!! 
Ah that day…the day you were truly open and overt about everything. Why can’t you be like that all day? Why can’t you be like the day we meet, soo pellucid that I was able to know that you’re alive inside. IS IT HARD??? Or I’m not even good enough to be your fan. I just like you a lot that it’s too much disguising inside. But you don’t like me that much even tho I’m pretty and shy. Honestly speaking idkr whether you like me or not. but I have this feeling that you’re taking time to decide and be mine. It’s better you choose the right one and be glad BECAUSE your best friend MR. MATH is thinking off taking me out. MR. BIOLOGY has also invited me to his dinner party while MR. CHEMISTRY confesses his feelings last night. So you better run fast and come to your true love before it’s too late my dear love.
Sincerely,

To the girl that has loved someone who didn't deserve her. 
First of all, I need you to know that you’re not weak. You’re not stupid. You’re not weird. You’re the complete opposite to all that.
You’re strong and brave. You’re strong for loving someone who didn’t love you the way you deserve to be loved. You’re brave for going through hell and back because of him. You’re strong for staying with him although he gave you a thousand reasons to leave.
You’re strong, but not in the way most people think. You’re strong because you undressed and threw your innocent soul under the feet of a guy who often forget your sacrifices.
You’re strong because you loved him more than you loved yourself.
But, he couldn’t, or didn’t want to see that 
He questions your love and loyalty when you have proved it a thousand times. 
You are the heartbroken. The disappointed. The hurt. The manipulated. The deceived. You’re everything, but weak.
You’re the girl who loves hard and unconditionally. Your soul is pure and untarnished by  the evil in the world. That’s why you always see the good in people, even in the meanest ones. And for that, I salute you.
I salute you for believing him.  
I salute you for not being afraid of letting your love for him break your heart and shatter your hopes. For having the strength to put up with his indifference, blame games, false promises, piles of excuses, and lies.
I salute you for forgiving him for all the bad things he did to you. For giving him thousands of chances although he deserved not even one.
I salute you for having the strength to heal your wounds when you were deeply hurt.
I salute you for not losing hope that things would get better. That one day, he’d realize the beauty of your soul. That he’d see your kindness, your love. I salute you because no matter how many times people told you that you should leave him and that you deserved better, you still decided to stay. You didn’t walk away because you thought and hoped he’d change because of you, and that he would choose and fight for you too. You loved and accepted the real him but he only accepted the fantasy of you. And yes, probably many will judge you for staying with such a guy and allowing him to treat you that way.  They’ll say you were naive and that you should have stood up for yourself. But, don’t let that upset you because they don’t love the way you do.They don’t understand that you aren’t afraid to get hurt. You wore your heart on your sleeve and allowed your love for him to break your heart into countless pieces. And yet, you were brave enough to pick them up all by yourself.
You were neglected, insulted, emotionally abused and humiliated, but you still chose to love and never stopped looking for the good in him. You loved the wrong guy, but you didn’t allow this to break your hope that true love exists.
That’s why I salute and admire you.And yes, love can be scary, hard, and painful. But, keep loving, Girl, because the most amazing things in life happen when you are about to give up hope. Remember that there’s always someone better out there, always a chance for something new. Never give up or settle for anything less than you deserve.
Keep loving, Girl, because one day you’ll find Someone who will choose to love and be with you every single day. Someone who will be grateful for having such an amazing person in his life. Someone who would fight for you. 
Keep loving, Girl, because there’s nothing in the world that the intensity of your love cannot conquer.

So, I've somehow.. Different ""problems"" than most people here. And pretty unusual.

The thing is that I have incredibly tantamount murderous intent. Something that'd give anyone a good nightmare if they'd seen inside my head.

I'm always planning, observing, calculating and contemplating for ways and versatility of eliminating those who are around me using tools I can locate and use motion accordingly.

I'm not scared I'd end up killing someone  (yea, right) and I don't see it as something serious either. Just.. Some sort of coping mechanism my anxiety and frustration that crowds and people create. I have full control and I'm calm person (but better safe than sorry) but it's good to take 'What If's into account.

Never been kissed.  

The kind of statement that builds a certain type of image huh?  
In all seriousness though, meet me. A 23 year old who's never really opened up to anyone. I am not shy or weird or awkward (although I do have my moments) or someone who lived under a rock or something It's just that.... how to put this.... I know I want to be close with my friends or my special someone but something holds me back. 
My life story is.... okay actually. I have got good friends,  good family, I mean of course there are problems and heart breaks but nothing strong enough to really break me. The friends are awesome, parents love each other but why am I scared to get attached? 
Now I know.  I know, to you dear venters,  to which my heart breaks every time I read your vents, to you this might seem like a joke of a problem but it's just something that started to bug me lately and I just wanted to write it out.  Although it's the sugar coated version,  bare with me. 
Since my young days I hated conflict and complications and misunderstandings and just everything that's not straight forward and I really avoided them and the source (the people) like the plague and somehow ended up subconsciously developing a defence mechanism to not get attached to people around me.  I will get close to people, can surprisingly understand their problems and help them with whatever I can, and care for them and have a good time but at the end of the day it's all just....... just....  
Am I too scared to get hurt?  Is that it?  Am I scared of rejection?? 
Specially towards someone to love....  Maybe I'm putting too high of a standard maybe I'm just unintentionally being blind to it I always end up simplifying or overlooking those who actually wanted to be more than friends. And it has happened. A few times actually, that I got too nervous and ended up nipping it in the bud before things get complicated.
You know what's funny though? I'm good at problems and always give advises to people so it's not me shying away from problems and expecting life to be all fine and dandy...
I never had a best friend or a serious relationship. They want it. I want it.  But....
I never cried in front of anyone or had a breakdown. I always fix myself alone.  And because of that I think they find it hard for them to relate to me.  
Am I too good at being alone? Is that it? 

It's too much blabbing about a silly vent isn't it?  Well,  thanks anyways...  I guess I'll have to take it one emotional step at a time....",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9804316163063049

I believe in true love so even if u give me a billion reason to give up I won't loose hope. I know u hate writing but u did that for me even when u are not sure that I will read it rly thank u like thank u for a lot of things. I know u will be mean and ignore me so I can easily give up but I won't because I trust u when u say or post that u will love me forever I heard that from your mouth by those eyes covered wiz tears to be honest I don't care even if u have a girl I know you won't love her like u loved me nd you said, ""fikir ande nw"" ya u are right u may go and years may pass but my soul will always be with u.

I know u are mad but I  can't loose hope. I know u will return to me nd fight to be with me it might not be now but one day nd when that one day comes I hate to say I told u so. 

For the love of GOD stop saying I don't deserve you we both know I both know that i don't deserve u nd stop saying that I deserve better cuz u are my better.

But I promise you to move on when your heart stop holding me. just admit it deep there u still want what I want being together. There is a reason for everything u step in to my life for some reason not to just visit nd walk out nd z reason is u are my soul mate.

Yes! I'm not afraid to get hurt I know whenever I'm down u will be there to fix my wounds to pick me up. Trust me I'm not amazing but u are. sometimes I'm afraid to say I love u cuz u are to much for me but my heart still wants u.
 I'm sorry for insulting you it's just I can't help it even I can't imagine u for a min wiz someone else but I will still be strong to wait u.

And I'm sorry that I couldn't make you happy
I'm sorry for not loosing hope
I'm sorry for everything  that I have done even to worry you on little things.
 
And I know God loves me when he put you in to my life nd said love will always have patient. I will wait u till z end.

One day my online boyfriend who I haven't met in person asked me to sex chats with him. I never did that and even though it felt weird I did it in a heartbeat since I was curious about it. And then... he sent me a pic of his dick without me even asking him and he asked me to send him nudes and I said no but he kept begging me telling me that it is not fair since I saw his...
So I took the picture and the stupid me didn't crop my face before sending it.. it was just a pic of my boobs with my face clearly shown. I remember him being so happy to see that pic and after some time... the two of us stilk haven't met but we were still talking everyday and I loved him. I mean I think so it was all kind of a joke and the guy was very cute anf handsome. One day we got into a fight because I didn't answer my phone and he once told me something personal about him and his single mother and I brought that up and insulted him. I swear to God that I was angry and I didn't mean it. He hang up and deleted his telegram account and the next morning I woke up to see 20 something messages from diffrent people. Like friends and close people. I called my best friend who called me the most and she repeatedly asked me if I am okay and I was smiling because she isn't always this caring and she told me that my online boyfriend has posted my nudes on a group on facebook and everyone saw it. I flipped out  I wanted to die I wanted to kill myself  everyone in school was staring at me as I walked the hall with my friends. This time showed me that most people in my life really truly care for me and they love me and the fake ones talk behind my back of how much of an idiot I am to make this happen. The boys I know were supportive and beka... everything was eye opening. Felt like my life curtains opened just like that.

So fucking tired of being told to study when thats what I do the moment I get home. What is wrong with them? Why can't they listen to me once? Just once. They throw money and object at my face as a sign of showing their love for me. My mom cries about not showing my brother enough love before going abroad but no one sees me. I am in the background, the whore, the one who doesn't get good grades, who isn't pretty enough. That's how they see me. I try so hard to prove to them that I am so much more than that. To be honest I don't even know who I am. I am just trying so hard to make them proud but maybe I am who they think I am. It's just hard to except it for myself. Knowing you're nothing but a waste of time, money and effort when there are so many kids out there with the ability to become sth amazing but aren't given the opportunity cause it's being wasted on you isn't a good way to live. Its better if i give up my place in this world.

She asked me my reason but I didn't tell her b/c I don't have 1 then in this year most ppl asked me why I did that and I answered I didn't like her but they told me I shouldn't do that b/c she was rich but they don't understand I wasn't up to that

You wake up to the sound of people speaking, to the sound of their shuffling feet. Waking up is the last thing you want, all you want to do is drown yourself back into the black unknown, to the world of oblivion. You try to get out of bed cause you know you need to go to school or work, but you can’t seem to muster the strength to pull yourself out of bed. It’s like every fiber of your body trying to compel you into slipping back to the great unknown. There is nothing more you would love to do, you would rather stay there then face the truth. But you can’t hide and run from it forever, though that’s exactly what you wish to do. But staying there…slipping back, means raising questions. They would want to know why, they would start wondering  what’s going on with you. You can’t have that. You can’t have them see you anything less than strong, happy and smart while in all honesty all you are is dead, depressed and lost. So against your wishes you drag yourself out of bed. You can barely stand let alone walk around. But still you go on with your daily routines hating every moment of it. 
Those feelings you wished to avoid, those you desperately loath come back flooding. The precious hours of safety gone and now you are faced with reality. You can’t bring yourself to open your mouth let alone eat. So you go on with your day with your body tired, your spirit shattered and your mouth glued. You see your classmates or coworkers and try to act as normal as possible. Yet you can’t. You do everything you can to avoid speaking to them. You minimize your conversation as much as possible. Even if you don’t want them to know, there is still a part of you wishing that they would see the death beholding you. It feels as if your drowning with no one to the rescue. You wish and hope to reach out, to find an anchor but you just can’t. You can’t stop feeling as if you’re burdening them, as if you’re forcing them into acting like they care out. So all you do is wallow in the emptiness you feel, alone. You feed off of self pity. You just wish it would all end. You’ve thought of stopping the pain. You’ve thought of killing yourself but for some reason you just couldn’t. Despite how compelling the idea appears to be it just never felt like the best option. So instead you just try to fine something. Some sort of hope to keep you going. But you can’t do that while the feeling of emptiness and numbness are always there. They are like the elephant in the room, no matter how much you try, you just can’t ignore them. So you try to find solutions. Ways to shake off these feelings. You try to inflict pain onto yourself. Hoping that the physical pain you experience fills the void. But that never lasts for long. You’re back to square one only this time it’s even worse than before. You can’t. You just can’t live life like this anymore. It’s killing you and you hate yourself for everything you have become. But guess what, it’s killing me too.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9880062937736511

Is life unfair or is it just created to make some happy and the rest sad, idk i will leave it for you to decide.......So, it has been a long time since i became the member of vent here and i have seen different sides of stories  like way different, Some complain of having a broke up  while some had never got the chance to even fall in love, some complain of fighting with their best friend while others are alone, from my point of view i think it is just about the timing when things are going to happen, starting from one day at a specific time, minute and second your life will be completely different those who were once alone and was thinking about suicide  will be sorrounded with ppls and regret for trying to end their life those who were once were heart broken will be compensated and be happy, LIFE don't just show you the good sides of it first coz if it did, u will get used it and become easly bored, So first  you are gonna have to see the worst and darkest parts of it , SO when you see the amazing parts of it you won't be bored and feel that you worked hard to see this part starts to enjoy it to the fullest extent. the reason am writing this is just my friend thinks Life is Unfair and always sees the negative parts in everything

I'm a 15 year old guy with OCD and social anxiety disorders. My normal and school life has been pretty much normal ever. Until recently when I am struggling to cope up with my fears and disabilities. I was fairly a known student in my previous school but I had to change my school because it provided with education till 8th grade. In this new school I'm struggling to find new friends as I can't move with the flow of the masses. I am currently in 10th grade and I am known as the awkward guy of the class with zero friends. It isn't fair to say I have no friends, I do have two close friends but that doesn't prevent me from being bullied by the edgy teens of the class. I am awkward as I don't have girlfriends like they all have. I can't talk with girls as not because I'm shy but I struggle in social interactions. I am regarded as an alien and ""abnormal"" which was even encouraged by few of my class teachers. I know they can't break my self esteem until I give up but I'm exhausted of being regarded in this way. I wish I could express my inner true self to them to show them that I'm not an abnormal guy who can't feel insults, that I have my self respect which when gets crushed makes me feel pain the same way it would be to them. I wish there was someone I could consult my parents but they are conservatives and will tell me it's my fault that I am treated in this way. I don't know how it will turn in the end, I am just hopeful that my life will be back to normal and I am able to stay in a world where I may be respected as a human being. It is obvious that this also affects my academics and general life as I spend 8 hours a day 6 days a week in school with no excuse to be absent. I hope that I can be myself again after this schooling journey ends which will take two more years. I hope I can be truly be myself without feeling disgusted and insulted. English isn't my native language so pls forgive me if I made any mistake.

So here it goes... I have a lying problem. I lie a lot. I even vented a lie in this channel. But this one is not a lie... I can't lie saying that I am a liar. I lie a lot. I lie to people right to their faces everyday. Families friends or even the people I know. I am at a point where even there isn't a way out of my likes and I can't like forget them and start again. And how to make a reason for a lie? Make another lie. I lie too much that I even do not have any idea how to control it anymore. My life is full fake shit. Betam betam new sewochen matalelew. I stab them at the back. From my parents to my friends and the guys that I have been dating everything is awful for me. I really get surprised of the things I lie about sometimes... Like... I ask my self How did I even think about this lie? Like... I am so smart when I lie and I am so stupid at other things. I cheat on my lover. I mean I love him but he isn't enough for me. Just not enough for me. He isn't that attractive and he has a jealousy problem but he loves me from his heart and I do not want to hurt him. I cheat with a lot of guys on him and he never knows because I never leave traces. NEVER. I am so good at this. Like so good. But I feel bad because I am not happy. Liars are not happy. Pretty much since I know it is a sin. So dear readers if you are going to comment something that makes you judge me... Please don't. I have seen the channel centers and even if what they did was bad... How the hell do you think they will feel when they find out that they can be called those names on an anonymous vent?

Hello dear venters I am 15 and I know that I am too young for this but I am a very depressed girl. I really don't love anyone. I hate everyone and most of them for a completely no reason. And most of the time I just happen to be trying to dig myself a reason to hate someone. I hate everyone but I am actually not mean to them. Most of the time they are mean to ME. Because I am actually kind of fat and I am ugly. My Best friend is not fat and she is beautiful and she is like an angel and she loves me. And I love her too honestly I am not jealous of her. I constantly get bullied in school and I can't even focus in classes because I always get distracted easily. And the other thing is that I can't study at my house because I always have social media (telegram) on my blood. I'm really addicted to it and no matter how much I try I can not stop it. I even hide my phone behind a book in front of my parents to text looking like I am studying so my social life and school life are messed up. I have bad grades and every year beginning I tell my self I will change but I can't. School life and social life down to religion. I was the good girl in the house. Everyone knew me as the girl who always prays and stuff then I became a completely different person. Like I changed my everything. I never pray. I swear by God's name and lie like it is nothing and i never go to church. I even make fun of God sometimes (please commenters don't judge me for that) and I am a huge sinner in the inside and the out side. On family life... I don't show love to my parents no more. I just ignore them completely like they are not there and I talk back to them often. And as for the love life... I never had a boyfriend because of my looks and stuff and I mostly catfish guys on telegram (Don't judge me for this one too) and beka... My life is a hell hole and it feels numb and meaningless and let me say something. I HAVE NOTHING AND NO ONE TO LIVE FOR. I cut myself now and then but then my best friend noticed and made me stop it. I just listen to music and use telegram after I come back to school.

This is not really a vent just a Q I've been asking my self and want to know ur opinion about it too.
So...the Q is what kind of relation status u want to have. I mean....
1. would u like it if u date ur-1st and last-one and marry him/her at last. 
OR......
2. Date whoever you like and continue in that road til ur beloved one comes and marry him/her.

So me and my girl got back together after some time apart. We didn't break up or anything there was just a bit of distance between us for a little while.p But we talked on the phone a lot during that time and I kinda developed real feelings for her. She was so layed back she let me do my thing she didn't really care that I partied too much or went clubbing or even hung out with other girls. And that kind of trust I've never gotten from nobody. But big shocker I fucked up and I took all that trust and threw it all away. I didn't actually cheat or anything but what I did wasn't much better. I lied to her and said nothing funny happened when I saw my ex. I didn't tell my ex I was seeing someone new it wasn't her fault it was all mine. The first time we hung out it was all innocent and shit we just had ice cream and we talked A LOT plus we made plans to meet up the next day at my house like we used too. So the next day she came by and she was in a mood talking all kinds of stuff and I had a moment of weakness. I can't get into the details but ik I fucked up. I can't do shit to change that now, all I can do now is at least try and make it up to her.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9972410202026367

So that's what happened to me, still happening to me. I mean I love him and I want to be with him, we have plan to get married soon but I said earlier am having trouble being intimate with him. Trust me I'm not type of girl who is out there when it comes to sex, like it's not my priority but I worry it will bring problem in the future, idk am confused. Help

Ps he loves 'our sex life'",love,NEGATIVE,0.9909293055534363

so here goes I have been in a relationship with the most amazing guy for the past 5 yrs.  things were great and all until last yr I had to go to campus to a very far place and I couldn't say no and stay back even though I wanted to do that.  I felt like I had some responsibility or some sort of debt to my fox so I went for a yr.... it was hard having a long distance relationship  so then we started drifting apart  then I came and we were.. ok ngr,   but not like before so I thought about it and decided to withdraw from there and told my parents and all then I stayed back home for good  .....so the thing is that he will be going to campus this yr and I don't expect him to stay back for me just cuz I did but then again if he goes I wont be able to see him,  in that case we're back to zero where we started ‍ what do I do..... he's everything to me my first in everything and hoping to be my last and I know that we can survive it and all but cmon how sure can I be ??",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9866742491722107

I've come to the relization that the way I go about searching for love and acceptance is harmful. I believe that in order to be loved I've to first accomplish some amazing feat . I've long persuaded myself that I'm not enough; no one in their right mind would love me just the way I'm. 
Mostly I find myself going for activities that are deemed ""badass"" by others, which makes it hard to pursue the things I truly love. This constant chase for glory, which I'll later cash in for the great love I think I deserve, has been draining  my mind and soul. There is this constant urge to perform, always on edge and always trying to prove my worth. Even when I'm chill it is a highly orchestrated act, which in fact  takes more energy from me to pull off.
All this comes to a stop when I'm with a few number of people otherwise its game time all day everyday. 
My fear is that the possibility of a mental breakdown occurring in the near future is very high unless I work on myself.

I am small and insignificant. So are you. So is everyone else. But because i know that, i no longer am. 
 So when i walk on the street, i walk with ease. I do not get surprised much. I try to go where there is love and happiness. Sometimes i don't, i just sit back and witness. Because i am small, i am not sad. Because i am insignificant, i am free. The space within me is only for love and things that lift me up. I look to the clouds and my heart soars. My body cannot fly but my mind and heart always have. I have flown to the stars and beyond the galaxies. I will not live forever. But everyday i taste infinity. I am glad to be. I am also glad to not be. I don't fret or worry, for the clouds float above me. They remind me, ""it'll pass"". My smallness, my insignificance humbles me. The fact that i am you and you are me and we are everyone, i revel in that glory. I may have felt alone in the past, but i never was alone. I have never been alone.

The venter before me got me thinking ...... 
Life.  Fair......

Life is and has always been fair.  The sun shines on the good and the evil.  Rain drops on the wicked and the meek. The earth holds the heavy and the light hearted. Everything was made perfectly and in an incomprehensible detail that is all on the even scale of its creator.
What made it unfair is us.  Our choices shape us and our fair or unfair life.  And if it's not ours it's the choices our father or forefathers made.  We are responsible for the injustice in this perfect world. We are always responsible.  If it's not to the humans next to us it's always to any life around us.  And what goes around comes around one way or another.  
We're too busy saying 'there's a benevolent man in the sky that sees a sick baby and does nothing!' while in all honesty it's our mistakes that put that child out there.  
If that man in the sky did take all evil out wouldn't we be in the blacklist too? 
I always ask myselft that too.  'why does He see these things and just stay quiet?' 
But if that infinite creator came to me and decided to elaborate all the reasons to the why would my finite brain begin to understand it?  So then how can I judge the why I can't even begin to comprehend let alone critique?
But I forgot someone else too.  The source of the evil.  So then humans were not the source.  We were just misguided and decided to rebel against the purpose we were created for and decided to be our own gods, which opened a way for evil and injustice to reek havoc in this perfect world.  
Then what's all this waiting for?  The trial?  The ultimate justice? The Supreme Court law execution? The parting of the good and the evil? 
The only power I have is over my choices. Then shouldn't I really start to be responsible and grow up for God sakes?

My soul is just beyond redemption! 
I carry scars that wont heal
Wounds that seem to run deep,
Deeper than the ocean
They say time heals ,
But with time passing i grow weary,
With each period knelling to an end ,
My soul shatters .
My mind travels to darker , deeper depths of my soul ,
Where my being is drowned in tears and sorrow ,
In reality that's what my existence has been .
They threw words like blades that slowly cut through me ,
Words that later became my new definition ,
Words tht slowly tormented the little and happy girl in me.
The blurry refelction of me in the mirror ,
Makes me wonder if was i a rough sketch in the formation of
man kind ?
The trapped soul in this body ,
Never seems to stop wondering whether it will ever find peace
I long to be good enough ,
To have laughter that wont quickly turned into tears ,
Happiness that is not leased ,
But all that seems like pipe dreams sold by politics ,
Maybe not all of us are made for a happy life.....
Maybe pain is my thrill,
My anxiety feels like I'm in a dark room, pitch black and the floor falls from underneath me. I keep falling and I claw on the walls wanting to grip something. Eventually I find my footing only to find that it was temporary. There are a thousand 'what ifs' in my mind. 

I lose my footing. I am falling again. I am screaming, yelling hoping someone listens but they don't. No one ever does. I am alone. No. Wait! I am not alone. What is anxiety if depression didn't accompany it? I have my loneliness to keep me and my company. What will quiet the noise? What will pull me out of this pit? God. Or death.

But guys.... *Wasn't time suppose to heal my pain?*
Isn't time the antidote for a broken heart?
Isn't time suppose to heal my wounds?
Nature seems not to be taking its course in my case.
With weeks piling up into months
My wounds seem to be tortured with salt.
Actions forgiven aren't they suppose to be forgiven?
I guess my mind is malfunctioning.
I blame this dis-functional world I was placed in.
Aren't I suppose to be afraid of the dark?
Isn't darkness suppose to toy with my imagination?
Yet i seem to find comfort in its shadows.
With the passage of time my being has came into acceptance
that some souls are beyond redemption. maybe some souls
aren't worth saving?
Wounded beyond healing
Broken beyond repair
What if hearts are meant to be broken?
What if tears are meant to fall?
What if promises are never meant to be kept?
And the irony of everything
What if I am not really looking for these answers?
Dont ask me reasons why and when i become like this! Cause when i know my self i found it like this!

Okay so here's the thing
I love you more than anything, I have done so for over a year now, and I do believe you when you tell me you love me too. I have opened up to you in ways I have never done so to anybody else, and talking to you helps me a lot. I am glad because that's how it should be. Problem is you dont open up as much as I would like you to. You only mention real stuff when you are mad at me or something. Even when you're depressed you stay away from me and that just makes me feel like an outsider.

I'm an avoider.

So whenever it was getting too hared to Handel I would cover my mouth and noes n hold my breath( a trick I picked up from one of the book been reading) and it was working my brain was too busy trying to get oxygen It wasn't thinking about anything else. but it doesn't last that long so I do this 3 or more times a day. depending on the day. so anyways lately I think I'm taking it too far n I don't wanna die. not yet at least so if any of u can suggest less...I don't know extreme way? to take things of my mind that will be really helpful.

Here is a little point of view , for all girls out there particularly domestic,  well you guys have a lot to offer and you guys are book if read can be a best seller but nobody wants to read the same type of books all the time , don't try and make yourselves what you aren't this generation has undoubtly set hypothetical standards for you guys to be considered desirable like have followers or likes or posting vacay pictures all the fucking time , like your job is vacation inspector or someshit where going to a particular event and taking a good picture is more important that having a good time,  don't be grounded , it's not happiness if everyone thinks you're happy ,cause happiness comes from within,  stop chasing after the same men , like the hole logic of it all has shifted , where the fact that one particularl person is more desirable just cause he has been with a number of other girls give the people that actually give a genuine shit about you a chance,  I know this may feel like you settling for less , but it really aint. No one is keeping score , those friends you try to impress right now  , might not be around in the next couple of months , surround  yourself with people who have grace and patience, unless you are flat out a golddigger stop going after the rich guys , life is not about the expensive shit cause most valuable things in life are free , connect more with guy who doesn't party all the damn time cause he doesn't have daddy's money to cover his ass,  and in time you'll see he is the one who has a lot more to offer you than the guy who is just waiting for a chance to get in your pants,  have class have pride and most of all integrity , Am not judging nor trying to in force this but rather an opinion for all them shallow people who somehow missed the point along the way .",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9918210506439209

Is it normal to be scared of being too happy?.. Cuz that's what am feeling lately.

And am trying so hard not to listen to that voice but it's always there.

So guys my first vent. I've got family issues me and my dad fought for about 3 and a half years now. We never talked, he didn't call me neither did I. I hated him for being so selfish that after he got divorced with my mom married to another and totally forget about us. Even me and my sisters. I'm the only guy in the house now. All the burdens are on my shoulder. I spend a lot of money for them coz I really do love them and don't wanna see em feel down.
But now my dad (I don't really like to call him that way tho ) he wanted to meet up. After all that shit I've been through now he wanted to say how sorry he felt. I'm tired of his trash talks. But heard he got quite big business and now he's rich and everything. If I started to meet him that I know my mom and my sisters wouldn't accept me. I'm young I suppose to live my own life by now. What should I do guys. I really appreciate your efforts and thoughts. Pls this is some serious challenge I'm facing. If I keep living like this that I'm sure I'm going to crash hard as fuck.

Hey you!
I miss you… yup! I do.
I miss you’re the light in your eyes, your voice, the sound of your laughter, I miss our chats about anything and everything, I miss laughing with you till we couldn’t breathe on such stupid jokes that weren’t even funny, I just miss you.
Even today I went out to take a walk and this beautiful girl approached me, so we chatted, and you know how nervous I get around girls right? I blabbed and well it was terrible, so she left. but I wasn’t sad because I was thinking what a good story to tell you and as I realized I can’t call you, utter sadness took over me.
And I got drunk for the first time! Yup! Felt shitty the next day but it was one hell of a night and it was fun although, I think you got too many annoying hiccups and that’s because your name was the only one that came up I mean, I wasn’t saying nice things about you but shit you hurt me so,
like I don’t know if I am a big part of your life but for me you were this huge thing, you were that girl in high school who's actually cool and all but hangouts with the nerds, yeah you were that for me so when you pushed me away that broke my heart and it was worse than anything I experienced before, it absolutely broke me.
Me, I thought we would be a forever thing I thought we would still talk everyday on phone about my endless crushes and your relationships, or talk about our futures, we even had business plans like that’s how you know we were for real! I thought we would be there for each other in everything, starting from wild college adventure stories, class graduations and even mocking job interviews when we big, and even choosing apartments then renovating them! I even planned out what I was going to do for your wedding, I was that sure like I would give you some expensive gift for your wedding which you obviously won’t appreciate but then I would surprise you with this amazing toast that would make you cry and all.",sadness,POSITIVE,0.9893593788146973

It is my first time venting.  whenever things get serious and I really need to say what I feel or if I get mad even if its something silly, my eyes fill with tears.  Usually someone asks why my eyes shed tears. Someone asking whats wrong makes it worse, it  makes me  start weeping.  I dont have any control over it. So when I cry people think I am weak, or that I am really hurt. Always trying to cover up my tears I dont say what is in my mind. 
This is being a big problem in my life for a long time. I have had a lot of embarrassing moments because I couldnt control my tears. Recently, I have cried trying to convince my boss in a topic related to work. She was completly shocked  because it was not a situation anyone  could be senstive on.

""When you smoke herb, it revels you to yourself"" 

Been smoking for a while now, and it's amazing how it feels like I'm looking at myself in the mirror. I see my past mistakes clearly, and I know exactly how to move forward with my life. It's like I've matured and aged 20 years or sth when I'm high. 

Also normally I'm not a religious person, but weed makes me feel wiser. Only time I think about God is when I'm high. I feel like doing something good for someone. Saw some new-born puppies in the ditch the other day. I bought fresh milk and bread to feed them. Normally I would've felt sad for them and just leave. I think, maybe the world would be a peaceful place if everybody smoked herb. 

Does anyone else feel like this?

The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A death! What's that, a bonus?!? I think the life cycle is all backwards. You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you go live in an old age home. You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, then, when you start work, you get a gold watch on your first day.  You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You drink alcohol, you party, and you get ready for High School. You go to primary school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little boy(girl), you go back, you spend your last 9 months floating with luxuries like central heating, spa, room service on tap, then you finish off as an orgasm!!

Hey lately I have seen a lot of vent by med students so ik we have many of u in this channel. So first of all I want shout out to you all b/c let's face it u guys are studying and working day and night like there is no tomorrow u guys deserve a real applause. 
But the reason I want to vent right now is to know how many of law students here handling law school. Because as a law student my self ik law school is hard and required a lot of reading and critical thinking on every single case (specially if u want a good grade). But what amaze me the most is even though we studied hard, understand the teachers every word, predict all the possible cases and have open book exam it is still hard asf. Sometimes I can't even believe its possible for the exams to be that hard but u can't judge till u take the exam.
However, there are some ppl who join law school without even realizing how it require a lot of reading just b/c they think it will make them smart or family tradition. But one thing for sure is this two reasons are the worst for law school b/c lets face it u can't survive there by that. There are also ppl who join and want to cheat, its still impossible b/c how can u cheat and pass the course and see ur self as judge after some years. How can u even decide when u have no clue about how the law work? So pls don't be a disgrace to this very respectful legal profession and join another field if u don't have the guts to sit for long hour and study. But shout out to all law students who are killing it and have a great grade on every semester in all law schools regardless of how hard it is u guys deserve to be respected. U guys are gladiator in suit

We all have our problems in life, the one we say anyone can't understand. 

But have u ever think that it is a good thing. I mean I'm not saying being ignored or bullied or friend zoned or abused or any others is good but thing about why God would bring this kinda things to our lives? why would he want us to struggle like this? I'm not good in this kinda things(religious stuff) but I know one thing for sure,it's all for a reason. Ya I know, you've probably heard this phrase a million times but it's true. If the thing happened to u haven't happened, u won't be the person u r today and the person who u r right now is created by the magnificent hands of GOD and u r created for a reason. So...don't, please don't try to harm ur self under any kinds of situation. 

Use what u have even it's so little. Use the chance u got in any means. Use everything in ur power to create what u like. Create ur own future. 

Don't sit back thinking someone will come and rescue u,that is in fantasy world, where we all get what we want without any effort. But this, this is the real world, the world of competition, the world of the TRUTH. So, stop crying for the time that have already passed, u are wasting ur time now by crying over the things that happened to u and never be able to replace by the happy thoughts we want to have had. But it's not the truth so don't expect it to be.

What's done is done.  

If u can do smtn to the future, do it! Just don't sit back. You've already fired the whole place in ur stomach. It's enough. 

Enough is Enough!

The point of this message is that u have to move on and build ur future life. I'm saying this from experience, you would probably be like"" 'snort' r u kidding me? U r too yang to know about life...""and stuff. But I know there is a great place out there and there is more left to be seen but I've been into some stuffs that brakes me everytime I thought about it. Everytime I hear similar actions. 

But now is another new day GOD has given me and I don't want to waste it by thinking about why it happened to me and disappointed him. 

The greater ur tasted by him the more he loves u cuz he want u to be stronger than ever, not do some bad things to ur self. 

I did tried to kill my self in the past, when I was really young, it was because of some lame family shit. But U know what.....now I thank God that I haven't done that thing that day. Because if I did I wouldn't be able to write this and share it to u fellas and meet amazing peoples out there and experience great days. My life is not full yet like I want it to be but I'm not backing down this time and I'm gonna work hard to work on it. 

I wish u all to be happy and strong more than ever. Life has a lot more than one person or situation that u r dealing with rightnow. 

""When life give u a hard time don't say 'why me' say  'try me'.""

I'm sorry it's really long and there are probably lots of mistakes there. So....sorry and also thanks for reading my thought and I hope it will help u and bright some light and hopes to ur situations and problems.

So here is a girl that everyone thinks is so perfect. She is strong, beautiful, peaceful, composed, a girl who's got it all. That girl is supposed to b me.

Me who cries in bathrooms just so ppl won't take my ""strong"" title away. Me with a future so blurry that I run out of motivational speech to give my self. Me the one who wishes to die in some way just now just today. Me who is always there for others but never expect others to be here. Yes that's the girl everyone thinks got it all together.
But hey am good. I know I cry now and then, which btw is a good thing since it wipes the storm inside and take a little load of my chest. I don't cut myself nor do i ever think abt that. I have my tears which is also scientifically the best medicine. I don't think abt killing myself either. But yeah I do think it wld b okay if I die today.

So since am alive today and I might b living for a while I try to make the best out of it. No matter how much the suffering and the pain. I will make my existence worth it. Eventhogh when it's dark and tmrw isn't exiting anymore, I think of tmrw just so that I can b zer for some one or some purpose. I believe life is worthy of living when it got some purpose for it.
So my loves don't be a quieter or a soft soul hang in there and let ur life matter if not for others for u and u. And don't let others be the judges of ur life line. U r THE One who can make it all work. Rise above the ashes and light up ur world ....love u all may peace b within ur souls",approval,POSITIVE,0.9555560946464539

Hey dear fellow venters I am here you are there I don't know most of you but I want to vent something here. Everyone in this channel must know how depression feels like, I mean I'm sure most of you do..
Let me get straight through my vent. You all must have heard a comment called ""Tsebel hiji/hid"" in vents. I want to say that it really helps. Yewnet Tsebel setetemeku netsa tewetalachu. God will heal you and get whatever is killing you inside hell out of there. Don't give up. Don't kill yourself. Go to the holy water and let God take care of your soul. Because I know you might not believe me or say how can she know and stuff and ignore it but hell is a very ugly and painful lesson to learn that you won't stop learning forever. Don't feel like God doesn't love you. God loves you whatever you did. If you don't believe in God and now you do but you're going the other way because you think he hates you for not believing in him before... You are wrong. Go to the Tsebel and see for yourself. 
Tsebel healed me. I hope it heals you too. Yewnet I even sleep better now. I feel like I am set free. I am no longer imprisoned in the hell hole I was in. I am okay. You'll be okay too. Go to God.",caring,POSITIVE,0.978651225566864

Lemme just say this in the few words that are able to share my ideas...well not few but too little for what I have to say 
Ok so religion and beliefs have a great place in our hearts well for most Ethiopians at-least 
Here’s my take on that 
So yea a god exists no doubt true he is beyond our imaginations and true he knows what’s what 
But I feel like he knows what will be what before it happens, so would it be fair to punish us for what he put inside us when he made us and reward us for praising his name and give us ultra privileges just cuz we admitted he’s the one 
Yea true you got your will and all but what good is that when your fate is destined 
What happens to those that did the greatest in life but just skipped the beliefs and lived in the real world for the sake of others 
And what happens to those that died before hearing the word of God, is it fair to punish them as well
How about those that chose a life of doing wrong because it was the only way to survive 
What about those that took their own lives because they couldn’t escape the torture of reality and couldn’t bear the pain 
Don’t get me wrong I know there’s much at work that I’m not able to grasp but if we are truly made by his image how come it doesn’t  seem just

About half an hour ago, I farted. Sitting at my computer as I do most of the time, this is something I've grown used to, but this fart really fucking stank. Seriously, it was like eleven dead animals with shit mixed in. I was sick and tired of having farts smell so terrible. But did I do what the sensible person would do, and get up and wait for it to disperse, perhaps taking with me the resolution to change my diet to better my smells? No, I did not. I took what I considered to be the alternate route.

I stuck a mint up my ass

I figured that since it dissolves in saliva, my ass would server a fair job of dissolving it, thus lining the end of my colon with a nice minty extract and making my farts the kind that girls would like to make out with. Somewhere along the line, however, I apparently didn't work out the way the dissolved mint would be absorbed into the walls.

Anyway, around 20 minutes passed, and I had to fart again. Being of a scientific mind, this would be where I'd prove or disprove my hypothesis, so I let her rip.

Oh god. It wasn't a fart. It was a fucking butt sneeze.

The mint had been dissolved, that much was clear. But what was left was spearmint jelly mixed with shit, and it was all over my boxers and running down my legs as I ran to the bathroom. I cleaned up my boxers as best as I could, scrubbed my leg, and tossed the underwear in the wash. So overall an embarrassing experience, and one I wouldn't want to relive.

Hello everyone! I will try to keep this short. I need help on some matter from doctors here or others that have the same experience as mine. A few weeks back i was diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder (BPD) and light depression. My psychiatrist told me they will put me on medication and will prescribe me sertraline (Zoloft) and I have to make up my mind by our next appointment. 
I am really freaking out about being on a medication even though I know I really need it, cause you know side effects and I am scared the drug will make me lose control of myself- more than I already have. And to make matter worse I moved alone recently; a thousand miles away from home, I have zero support system, I am going to uni full time and working part-time. All these things are adding up and are breaking me down for real. There is really no one I can turn to for advice hence why I am here. So has anyone here ever taken sertraline, or for the doctors here, what should I expect once I started my medication? Is it even the right thing to do?

But i recently found out that she's been diagnosed with kidney failure and she is dying due to some complications with here immune system. I dont know what to do. Should i be there for her or should i just try to move on? I need genuine answers.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9949628114700317

We were board and we were at some place and I told him to go to his friends because he was doing nothing and he said he needed something from them and I gently asked him to be with them because he is doing nothing here and he got mad which I begged and apologized for. He accepted my apology but he doesn't talk to me in school he acts like I don't even exist he acts like um trash to him.

Ufff I just wanna die  I ask nothing but to die. They don't listen to me. My voice has no meaning to them. It's them and only them. I wish i could stay for the ones that love me and whom I love but it's torture being at home. I can't take it anymore. They hate me and i don't blame them but the least they could do is hear me out some times. I am an absolute stupid person to my mom and dad well he ain't even home for most of it. She chooses everyone else over me. When am I ever gonna feel the love from my family? I am trash and nothing more. There is no one here to have my back and I have to cry myself to sleep hearing the insults coming from the other room. I don't have enough pills to overdose or enough power to cut my wrist deep enough so I only have a rope. If i hang myself then it will all be over. I want them to know how miserable they made me feel. They will know that it was them who caused this and no one else. I want them to suffer. I want them to be hated by their loved ones. I want them to die in agony just like me.

Me and my homie were hanging like for 4 years when we start disagreeing he would paint me how am like this kind of a guy and bring proof from 2 or 3 years ago like moments i acted like that person and he told me then he didnt say anything (tageskuk) because i dont know that is fucken virtuous? Really ...or me and my ex when we fight she  would say how couldn't u know u r a man like mans are telepathic, FUCK! , we need to talk on what and what not 
Yeah i know u might say this could work like when u are disagreeing with a stupid ppl or ur fucken superiors bt No this is where u are u r WRONG, saying nothing become the smartest thing to do is just because u do not have any thing to do other than that i mean u r not samr enough to make the stupid person to understand nor powerful enough for u superiors to listen to you

Hey all, so a quick question.
Does anyone here really actually believe in God? I mean i am not naive enough to believe this amazingly structured world and our perfectly engineered body was created by a big bang. I believe there is a creator. But then again, doesn't it bother you the silence of God during the Holocaust, the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and now in Syria and Yemen. Isn't it a bit unsettling that all this is happening under the watch of God? And if He isn't moved enough to spare innocent lives do you think He will be bothered even a little bit to be there for you in your individual life?",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9952849745750427

Hi there, 
Oh I can't believe am venting but am in a sticky situation and I want advice on it.... so here is the deal I have been with this guy for 6 years he is amazing and we really were in love. But there were always things to make us fight and taking a break from the relationship was a usual, and I knew that it was Un healthy but I told my self what relationship doesn't have problems so ours have few and it doesn't matter. But it mattered, because I got hurt by his actions every now and then. Don't get me wrong am not saying everything was bad, we really had great moments and were so in love. anyways finally I decided it was enough and pulled the break on the relationship, usually when I say I wanna break up he gets some kind of way to convince me back but this time I was stubborn and he didn't fight hard enough so we broke up. I was fine at first even ignored his "" I miss u"" txts but now week goes by and I am in a situation I can't handle. I don't sleep, I don't have appetite at all, I don't get out of the house, I am just sad like to the point if some one says anything to me I want to cry and most of all I just miss him, I look at his online status I look at his pictures and listen to his recordings again and again it's just insane. I wanna call or text him but I can't I mean I am the one who broke it off I am the one who said I don't want you I am the one who ignored his calls so how is it fair that I call now and ruin his mood. Am just soooo fucking confused....",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9917764663696289

So I'm the type of person who is the odd one out in a group of friends. Ever since i was a child, for some reasons i don't know friends do stuff behind my back or just have me follow along without really including me.  When we were assigned seats in class, some said infront of me that they don't wanna sit with me. I should mention that i am also hard of hearing. So really i didn't really care at the time because i don't value those ppl and so their words and actions didn't have any effect. Or so i thought. Until today. I was excited about something and went to tell it to my fam and i pretty much got no reaction except one person. This wouldn't faze a normal person but for me it was a big deal. I couldn't stop replaying the scene in my head. It brought back all the times i felt left out. I wanted to cry but no tears came out. I realized how those situations have shaped me to the present day. For example when i text and someone doesn't reply i really hate it. I prefer if they would just say bye or sth. All these have taught me to enjoy myself in solitude. Atleast them am not worrying if I'm inconveniencing others, or if they don't wanna be with me.

So I was watching a YouTube video the other day and it completely changed the way I saw myself in relationships. The video was about how our childhoods shape the type of lovestyles we use as adults and it goes into detail about it. Basically there are 5 types of lovestyles(the pleaser,the victim,the controller the valiant and the avoider)  but I'm only going to talk about mine the Valiant. As a child I had both working parents they both worked 24/7 for a better life for me and my sister but in the process the didn't give us a lot of love and attention growing up. And when they did I was just too tired and angry to receive it. So now when I'm in a new relationship I tend to idealise the rp and expect too much from my partner to fill the void I had as a child. In turn all the rps I've had(and I've had quite a lot) fizzle out after 2 months cuz i feel I'm not getting what I want from them so i just end it. I saw the video after my most recent break up(about a day ago) and i realised i wasn't being disappointed by my gf but the expectations in my head,that was what was letting me down. Maybe it's a little too late to go back to that rp( cuz I've done things i can't take back in that one day we were apart) but maybe I can change myself for the next girl and keep my expectations at bay. Watch the video if you can and comment down below what kind of lovestyle you have I'm really curious to know. Thanks for reading.",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9965930581092834

I'm really good at my academics, I do a lot of extracurriculars and I even got elected as a member of the school board committee, and I'm very social people know me and word got out that I'm still a virgin. I mean I don't think its wrong that I am but people at my school seem to think that there is something wrong with me given the fact that im very interactive and approachable but I just think I have greater priorities. And given my very firm stand on this the only reason that I'm asking for opinions here is that this is messing up things for me at school, some ppl point at me and laugh, I'm not respected like I used to be and I just found out that I'm literally 1 of the 4 virgins at my school and the 3 are kinda not known I think I mean no one made them a big deal but I'm practically being bullied for it, so what do u guys think I should do?

Hey guys, I'm just happy to be alive! Life is awesome! Enjoy it. Just like Yin and Yang, for all Yangs there's a yin to balance it, don't get mad because you only saw the Yin or the bad parts, nothing is prefect, everything is balanced, even in the Good things there is a small black dot, the trick is to enjoy life as is...

Hello, It's really not a vent.....it's more like sharing a life experience of mine......I have been through a lot.... I used to be a victim of sexual Impurity I even got depression from it and every time I see the vents in this group I wonder to my self how much pain and greif are people living with.......but A lover crossed my paths .....I know it might look dumb to the world but jesus is the one who saved me from my pain, He is really not a religion... he is looking up to souls but he can't force anyone it is up on our free will..... He was there when I cried ,he comforted ,he was an amazing dad, alover,a carrier.....if it wasn't for him I don't know what I would be know may be I would have committed suicide or got crazy ....but he said you're mine Nothing will posses your heart except me...and you won't believe if I tell you my change was a one night thing....
Now my heart is beating for him and I am flourishing in his house.......learning and I am a happy person now all thanks to him.....
So brother and sisteres I want to tell you no matter in what situation you are in,Jesus is waiting  with  Open arms....if He can changed me there's no reason he won't be a help to you bcoz only God knows how much my life was a mess..... Sorry for the long vent 
I love you all....and Remember Jesus lovess you like no one else could do!",sadness,POSITIVE,0.9270661473274231

I tried to believe in God, gave it all I had but nothing has changed. People say I don't believe cause I asked and was not giving. That may be a contributing factor but really I just see God as a sign of hope, as a meaning for life, someone we admire, wanna live up to. I guess it's the moment I started to lose faith that I started to want to leave this place. I want to believe but I just can't. You're probably gonna say ""read the bible and let him guide you"" or ""just open your heart to him"". I did. I went all in but at the end of the day I am all alone.

Hello there! 
   I don’t want to come off critical or something but I want to say this. I barely see people be concerned with Ethiopia’s Future; we are the next generation soon to replace our parents’ generation. Our country is in a absolute mess: students don’t care about class anymore and now find cheating their best way out of failure. Employees in every sector tend to involve in some treachery that would get them a fortune in a short time. What is really happening? These days also girls be called names and guys be cool for rapping well. Like really? We are one of the poorest countries in the world; that should strike our head sometimes. We should work diligently and try to be better citizens. You may not realize our backwardness but perhaps you will if you set your foot on other countries where hard work pays off. Our GDP per capita is as low as $760. Like we are scarcely living. Please put off all the fun and prioritize important things in life. I am not asking too much. If you are a student, please avoid cheating and focus on your studies, and if you are an employee, avoid corruption! May God bless Ethiopia!",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9970213770866394

Ik for a fact people around me talk shit about me and don't like me or think I'm immature and the people that do actually care about me don't know that side of me. But the reason i make all this things up about myself is cuz i want people to like me and i want to connect with them the way I see them connect with others and i feel like I'm not enough for that.

I have so much anger so much rage that boils inside me when I talk to him cause he is after all the one who planted those memories in my head .. And I don't wanna let the anger loose 

He gonna tell me some rude things he doesnt mean I'm sire, he gonna tell me that my life will be over once I start ""disobeying"" him... I tried to live by his rules but I couldn't take dissapointed those who knew the real me anymore

Hey guys...
Do u have that one friend who is very good at giving advice to others, the person who everyone goes  to when they r in a crisis, that one guy who always has a solution for you, but when he is the one who is in a problem, there is no one who can help him. Well,..... that's me. I have been here for a long time now, Trying to give advice to ppl, help them n stuff. But today the table has turned and am asking for ur advice.
I have always been an asexual (in case u r not familiar with the term, it is a person who has no attraction to either gender). I'm 20 now and I've never felt an attraction towards anyone, neither a guy nor a girl. But I really want to have a child of my own (which is another problem that i have to set aside for now)... Most people think that I am gay cause I only hang out with girls, like girly stuff and never actually dated anyone even though there were times i could have been in a relationship if i seized the moment. But i have never been interested.
 I have this ideal mate in mind. A person I think I ""might"" be attracted to. But I always assumed, the probability of that person existing and me meeting that person is verrrrrrry low. But guess what, I met that person. And he is a guy. He is like the most caring person ever, we have tons of things in common, I have never met someone soooo much like me. Not even my bffs. Plus he is very handsome. It hasn't been long since we met but I feel like I have known him for years. Everything he does or says amaze me. I feel so excited when I c him, hear his voice or see his texts. I can't stop talking about him. I stay awake at night thinking abt him. Even if I get home after spending the whole day with him, ynafkegnal. I have feelings that I just can't explain. I tried looking it up on the internet, but uk... it isn't as helpful as a real person. And above all, he is gay and he is out. Honestly if the feeling I am having towards him is real, I don't c the point of hiding it. I will definitely come out, and live my life with a fresh start. If ppl in my circle accept me, great. If not, fuck them. I will meet other people who will accept me for who I am. I am not looking for acceptance here I just want to know what I am feeling.
P.S: if u don't have positive things to say, don't bother commenting cuz it won't really get to me. I am dead inside when it comes to manchild assholes who have nothing better to do than teasing ppl who ask for help.",admiration,NEGATIVE,0.9905487895011902

I failed or about to fail my first semester which is really scary but I’m numb about it I have literally gave up on my self cause ik I’m not capable of the school life for reasons like I don’t know what or who I want to be . I’m just here for my parents . I’m scared of my future which makes me have no hope on my todays . I pray but I feel like my prayers repel the doors of God cause the things that happen to me are the exact opposite of what I ask or thank for . Can I be judged for questioning God ? Cause everyday ends up being sense less and useless cause everyday I fail everyday pains in a way can’t feel . Each day keeps on proving me I’m never good enough for the outside world and now there’s a 100% chance of me ending up in probation what am I going to tell my dad ? That he paid this much to watch me fail myself? What do I need ? I can’t say friends cause the people here can’t me more shity than this . I want to improve but how ? How?

-things that take creative ideas.
- things that after u r done doing them,u can do other things and enjoy ur time,explore and learn by urself .
  What I hate
-things that require constant focus.
-things that keep me from exploring,learning,and finding out new things
-things that are must and not flexible and most definitely working for someone u hate or slaved by someone holding against ur inner talent.
-I hate studying about  a ton of informations that I hate or will forget them in a second after I am done with exam.

Here's something I've been wanting to get of my chest for a while now. Basically I'm was good guy a little too forward and flirty sometimes but always loyal. I've always had a certain kind of respect for women because I was raised that way and I've always treated all my previous girlfriends with nothing but that. Then I met this girl, I'd never seen her around campus before but right after the moment we met something felt different I wouldn't call it love at first sight cuz it wasn't her looks that got me it was something much more than that. So uk how it goes we were ""friends"" for a little bit then we started going out and slowly but surely i fell for her cuz i felt like i could trust her so i did... i let go just and went for it. Worst mistake I've ever made cuz she started to let go the same exact moment. She completely shut her self of  from me and  she wanted nothing to do with me untill she did but even when she did it was just fun for her. I was her play thing she would pick up when she wanted and set aside when she didn't. In such a short amount of time she broke me and made me feel so insignificant like a nobody. So I did what anybody with some selfrespect would do and ended it but it wasn't the end i still felt shitty so i distracted myself with other girls just trying to drown the memories of her in my head. It's only been a week but I've been with 3 other girls. So just know for everyguy that's like me there's a girl like her who made him this way.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9652889370918274

I really love her and I asked her out, and she said no. After that I wanted to respect her wishes n continued being her friend, rather than totally loose her. But a few weeks later she told me, in the middle of a conversation, that she doesn't say yes right away when someone asks her out.

Hey guys
I am a male age almost 23 I am in a serious committed relationship with the girl i love. We planned our whole life together and planned to get married once she graduates. The thing is that i have only been with her and she has been only with me. But when we have sex its mostly to her satisfaction... I tought maybe its because we are both fresh and waited for it to get better... Even tried to spice things up but months went on and still nada! And i know i wanted my first to be my last and all but now am questioning everything i mean? Thats all? Thats what sex is? I tought about doing it with someone else like some meaningless hook up but it wont be fair for ma girl... And me sitting quiet is not fair to me... And if things go as planned and we live our life together will this be my life? I atleast want to see what it feels like to be satisfied with a girl who knows what she is doing... What do u think i should do? Am confused... Be open and say whatever comes to your mind",confusion,NEGATIVE,0.9799110889434814

So this is not much of a vent really, there is this chick who is always trying to converse with me and you know I don't like saying it but I think she likes me or something, I mean she is fine and everything but Oh My God her breath gets me breathless if you know what I mean, her mouth is so stinky it's like a potty hole. She thinks I am playing hard to get but am not. I am just disgusted I want to buy her pack full of mint and a whole brushing kit (toothpaste, brush and a flosser) I am afraid it might get of a bit offensive if I do that. I know I find hot when chicks smoke but it is not worth it.

So this is gonna be a long one bear with me. 
This is for all of you that say they're gay, suppourt ppl that are gay or choose to ignore it.
I know insults will just solidify your position so let me reason with you in real life terms please don't try to drill holes in this or look for spelling mistakes these are the facts.

1) Socially speaking being gay is possibly the stupidest thing you could ever do in Ethiopia,  everyone will hate you and will eventually eat you alive trust me i have seen it happen to girls who were caught I can't even imagine them coming out.

Ethiopians are killing eachother for speaking a different language and you are thinking of doing this, get real!

2) And also I used to think leaving people like you alone was the best thing, live and let live you know, but BEING GAY IS EVIL not from the religious point of view but from statistics (u can check this)

In the USA openly gay people constitute 3.8% of the total population but they are
40% of pedophiles
55% HIV cases
82% Syphilis cases
37% of anal cancer
less than 50% of gay men are STD free
most children with same sex guardians report abuse 
It gets worse in Europe

To get a clearer understanding of this google the movie 'The normal heart' its not anti gay propaganda by the church or anything like that its the ugly side of homosexuality 

3) And if you think you have a specially wired head and would never be in these situations lets get on the medical side of this

One of the requirements to donate blood in the USA is that you (a man) haven't had sex with another man in the past 2 years (notice that it specifically says sex with a man and not anal sex in general) this is one of the requirements listed alongside not having hepatitis, HIV etc... And there have been a lot of 'movements' to change this but its science and you can't wish it away. 

Another thing is anal sex exposes you to anal cancer- because of the human papilloma virus(men who use their  anus to have sex are 2X as likely to develop malignant tumors in there- for contrast exposure to radiation only makes you 20% more likely to develop malignant tumors there) (I'm a bit shady on those numbers but you get the picture)

There is also a cluster of HIV and Hepatitis A/B cases around homosexuals. You are 60X (yes sixty times) more likely to contract HIV, 62% of ppl with HIV in the US got it from sex with other men, HIV used to be called GRID (GAY related immune deficiency disease) and its name was only changed for political pupouses

You are also 50% more likely to go into substance abuse

And when we come to psychological issues theres a treasure trove of diseases and syndromes you are more likely to develop including depression and anxiety (maybe because of society) 3% of men in Scotland (a homo-accepting country as you know) have attempted suicide-an 8X higher rate than the general population 

(Sorry for all the stats being from the USA but you can be sure it'll be the same here if not worse)

Never mind what the Ferenj people are preaching, these are the facts hidden behind it and if you're so arrogant as to just ignore this and not reconsider your life choices you'll find out the hard way.

And I know most of you who write 'Be who you wanna be' on this channel are just saying it to sound different and be against society feeling rebellious like most young ppl wanna be but this is too far pls stop sending out the messed up message that being gay is in any way an ok and sustainable way of life.

I didn't write this looking for counter arguments ppl just shouldn't be gay. 
And if you say all this doesn't change your mind stop pulling people to this self destructive way of life.

I dont think my family loves me like I feel so lonely lately around them and feel like an odd one out all the time. Even today we were decorating the house for my nephews circumcision party and I did most of the work but got called out by my fam and they all told me how lazy I was and not do anything like Im invisible and everything I did was not there Im so tired of fighting back now that I dont even say anything back at anything they say. If they buy food even they would never call for me to eat but eat together and seeing them together later hurts me because they know I was in the house but yet never bothered to call out to me to come eat even. Is it just that hard? But people always say that the youngest in a family is always loved the most but Im the youngest and Im never loved :"") atleast I dont feel that. Im not saying my family is bad because there are things that they did for me that Im grateful for but after I turned 18 just everything changed I feel like Im on my own all the time with everything and seeing others being happy and taken care of by their parents really hurt but Im really happy for them :"")",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.5917210578918457

I'm 17 and I am a girl. I am that girl that sits at the back of the class  the nerd but no one calls her a nerd and she doesn't  claim that name but she is. Well let me explain... I kinda know how to hack phones and do  so many other cool stuff too. I hacked peoples telegram accounts. So many people as many as I can find from groups,  channels and other sources. I hacked my friends and also relatives and well this is what I realized...
You know those girls who get tattoos and show them off on their profile picture and just girls who take hot sexy pics? They ARE insecure. Everyone wants them to have a chat sex and things  as disgusting  as that. And they know it but they don't believe it. They save things from channels that make them feel good and they join channels that talk about depression like corrupted souls and Beautiful  mess. And as for the girls and boys who don't  post their own pictures... most of them not all catfish people. With different  identities and names and pics and even sometimes  personalities.  They just can't  accept  themselves  and that is the reason they do that.  I don't  judge them. But how they seem to have a huge capability  to lie like that is amusing. And please for God sake I DON'T  CARE ABOUT  PEOPLE'S PRIVACY what so ever. Why do people like being nice and stuff... no one knows... 
Point of this vent is...
Most people judge books by their covers like you all judge people by their social media accounts. Just live your life  people have their own problems so don't  think worry  too much about others comparing yourself with them. 
And the people who catfish... I don't  know how to say this... do many people want to talk to you. So many people stalk you. Be who you are. Be confident. It's all nuts and games until you find someone that accepts  you as you

Hide my identity
I have an abusive older brother who used to make our(me nd little sister's) life a living hell when we were younger. He did so many terrible things to make us suffer and he enjoyed it.He never showed us any affection like an older brother we were always scared and frightened cuz we don't know when he will start abusing us. I remember this day when I was in the shower and I heard my sister crying and begging him to stop but he didn't and I couldn't help her I just stayed quite. I know I should have been there for her but I was afraid cuz I thought he will find me too. I'll never forgive my self for turning my back on my sister when she needed me the most. The saddest thing is no one cared enough to make him stop except our dad but he rarely come home due to his job. Im 21 now and I haven't talked to him for the last 10yrs. After we grew up we just shut him out of our lives its like a defence mechanism for protecting ourselves. This all happened yrs ago but I cant forget about it!!! I can't even get closer to guys I always freak out when they touch me what's wrong with me?? And now he wants to reconcile and make peace with us. I want to forgive him and move on with my life I really do cuz im tired of hating him and the anger im holding inside of me is eating me alive and l don't want to upset God but I just cant stop thinking about those days and the look on his face when he abused us pls help me how can I forgive him?? And forget about all the things he done?",sadness,POSITIVE,0.9446069002151489

Hey everyone! So this is really hard for me because I'm usually the quiet guy/gal in the corner but this has been eating away at me for a while now. I've been reading stuff here for a while now and seeing the community that's been built around just letting go of all your negative emotions has inspired me. I have a lot of trouble making friends. I think I'm nice enough, I shower regularly and it usually goes well for the first few weeks, but then, without fail I start getting attracted to them and completely shut down. Guys, girls, doesn't matter. Everyone seems fair game and I just can't help it. When they start to avoid me, I threaten to kill myself even though I'm a pussy who'd never do it...and that has mostly worked so far. But I can still tell. It's not the same anymore. They're not the same anymore. It's funny, actually, I drive the people I love away and get mad at them for leaving. Hopefully I'll finally muster up the bravery to make friends or end it all.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9364292621612549

I feel so not right to admit this cause I am very independent. But Lately am noticing more of it. I am surrounded with friends I consider counts me back as a friend. But lately I am sure am the second hand friend. Like the only reason why we are friends is because we are stuck together for this time being. They show me less love. They wouldn't do shit they would do for their/our other friends for me. There is a double standard thingy. Normally, I always expect disappointment from people, so am not usually surprised. But after some years of meeting and living with someone...... You can't help but expect. And am a good friend. I hear them vent it out, I try to help better themselves, I will be there for them when am feeling like dying inside......... Oh how much I wish for a Real friend! One who loves me bare.

Ooookay so this isn't really a vent but something that happened and I kinda feel bad abt it (even tho it's not ENTIRELY my fault)sooo I've never went on a date before Sure am 17 and it's not a big deal and am not trying to force it or anything but I just wanted to know how it was. The guys that ask me out are like hey why don't u come  and I'll show u a good time and it's just gross. But this one time I was like u know what fuck it am gonna do it and I did and let me tell u it did not end well. It could probably be on the worlds shittiest dates list,so my friend felt bad and kinda set me up with her brother and he was being a dick,he was way to self absorbed he literally talked abt himself for like an hour straight and i really really tried to be nice abt it but when he couldn't stop talking  I just snapped and I told him to shut his mouth for a sec cuz the world doesn't evolve around him and other mean stuff.. Soooooo now that am venting it kinda sounds pointless but I kinda feel bad abt what I said I mean don't get me wrong he deserved that like I can't even describe how arrogant he is but now he told his sister(my friend) and she's like blaming it on me and she's ignoring me and everything.

I just wanna start by sayin im not a whore. So here is the problem. I can't seem to choose between this 2 guys.  So help me.
#1 This guy is great makes me laugh a lot. I just feel genuinely happy when im with him n is really hot n has great teeth n lips (yup thats my weakness). But the problem is he is so damn prideful. We talk on the phone but its rare like once or twice a day. N he expects me to call him everytime. Besides if we end up together he doesn't hv a job n we prolly be geetin high n doing dumb n silly stuffs. But there is no future. 

#2 guy. he is fun. He makes jokes but i just fake laugh n shit.  He cares about me ik by the look in his eyes. He is such a good guy n he has a carrier he is a dj. We also be hvin fun but we don't get high or ntn. Just normal stuff. Ik that if we continue there is a well built future.

It was last year, life put me in a path of tornado. Or a fate i dnt knw. I was outside z campus to copy the handout we were given.(but was not so far). I was alone. Zer was no one around. it was around 12:30 pm in local. I saw a man coming towards me. I didn't recognize who he was untill he gets close.(well he was a schoolmate, a year senior. I knew he had a big big crush on me, i was in no position to start a relationship & i guess me rejecting him made him feel like  he is underestimated). He gets very close and was nervous too.  He asked where i was going and other silly stuffs. Soon later he handshakes me as good bye. I felt his hand grabbing  my arm, like all over my hand. i remember z moment like a dream. everything blurred. My legs couldn't carry my body. Yeah he applied some kinda drug or i dnt knw what, on my skin. The next morning i woke up in a hotel i never went. I felt a severrrrrrrrrrrrr pain in between my legs. I was bleeding. No body was in z room & i remember nothing. I felt empty, destroyed, hopeless. Yigebachihual gin??? DO YOU? Meramed mekom alechlem. I tried to pee(never experienced zis kind of physical pain in my whole life). I was raped &i was virgin. I didn't tell anyone! Men teblo ynegeral? Men??? He didnt show up at school since after. Things got worse. 32 day later i find out i am pregnant. I aborted it(i was almost abt to die wen doing this). I carried all the emotional and physical burdens alone wiz my sister. Only she and I. I failed in exam. Got Expelled from z university. Family  screamed on me knowing nothing. I died! Not once or twice, just a million times. I break in to pieces. I hated everything. Nothing worked out for me. Am obsessed am nothing. It killed me inside. Hv ntn to live for. Idk hw many of u can understand the condition i am in(even a little!). Am i gonna hv a life?

Hi guys... This is not a vent... This is a something I need advice over.....

There is this girl I am dating. And she is unbelievable. She is sweet, she is kind, she is funny, she is cute, she is georgeous. In short, she is perfect for me. And I love her, in a way I didn't know I could love another human being apart from my family.

My problem is that, I constantly feel like she is too good for me. I feel like I don't deserve her, but I want her so bad. We are in love. She loves me back too.

But I am constantly worried. I keep asking my self, ""What would I do if she breaks up with me?"" It's not that I don't trust her, no. I can trust her with my life. But she is that good to be true for me.

I'm going to talk about something that's been bothering me about this channel and that is ""slut shaming"". I wish i could use another word other than slut but that's what its come to. Women just like men have the desire to have casual sex. Forget all that shit about double standards this is out right moronic. Sex isn't something to be ashamed of or be disgusted by it's most natural thing there is. Everyone and i mean both women and men want to, think about and fantasize about sex. Thats why there are 8 billion of us out here. Basically all I'm saying is although society shames women for there desires we as individuals should be better than that. Respect in the belife that women can have sex lives just like men without being called all those awful hurtful names...the same way you respect someone who believes in something you don't believe in whatever your reason.

Im in a serious relationship with this guy who is 10 years older than me. And he is neither rich or educated and has average look. (incase the age difference made u guys think that way)
He has a very kind heart and is very caring. But he is not romantic at all. Verbally....
And grow close after he took a good care of me when I was sick last year.
But problem is these days, I find it very uncomfortable when he refuses to do simple things ( like having lunch together)
Sometimes he makes me think he's so in love with me n other times he is just an ass hole to me. We've a lot of differences (religion) n I sometimes think maybe that's why he is changing a lot (because he ain't sure if he's doing the right thing)
I find it very annoying n keep comparing him to my ex who was just 2 years older, very brilliant, has good profession n very romantic....(I don't have any intention of going back as I live my current bf v. Much) n It's Hard for me to let him go because he is the only friend I've got. But he really annoys me at times.

I want to know what yall would do if yall been an unemployed graduate taking care of your sick mother for almost 2 years in a situation where you cant do anything about it being an aspiring artist on the struggle with really big dreams and God made promises that you'll make it in your heart and all you want to do is chase your dreams....just when you're soooooo fade up with it all..you find enough money to get you started on chasing your dream with a chance of actually making it happen your only sister comes in your life with a broken marriage and kids needing your help and literally asking of you to pause your life and take care of her situation so she can restart....basically take care of someone else AGAIN .... I am not a bad person. I love my family... but I gave a gut feeling that my God given talent could put an end to a lot of these bullshit that's happening around us... I want to help my sister.

Wassup. I been seeing some straight up dangerous shit this past week and I wanted to tell em what I felt. I don't know you. I don't know the miles you traveled. But I know that you're human. This means things cannot be good all the time. They say a man's success is based on what he has achieved, I say it is based on what he is able to accept. And if you think shit ain't going right, don't think it's because you're an unlucky piece of crap that's got no place here, you're just human; think it's because you're human and it happens to everyone out here. No matter what happens tho, NEVER DENY you have problems. Accept it. Accept the fact that you're going thru a rough patch, and that you need to find a solution. And I don't really know about your religion, but let me tell you my idea. If this world was to be of no struggle, why would heaven exist? Exactly no reason. So I want you to get your asses up, look straight up to your problems, and say "" Not today"". The world is made for those who can fight ;it's also made for those who can't. That's why we're different. But to those who can't fight, remember that you're still alive, and you got every inch of reason to live.

Long story, it might be boring. Sorry for the typo's. 
I just lost all of my university friends. One of my friends always ignores us without letting us know what exactly the problem is, every time she did that I understood and apologized eventhou it wasn't my mistake...... 
Anywho what happened was she texted saying ""you are a very funny person"" ""smh"" I texted back saying what did I do, She ignored me. I even asked her in person but she ignored me and got annoyed, naturally I did the same. 
long story short i told a friend we should go out with everyone, including the girl i had a fight with since it's her birthday .
she told me that I need too work it out with my other friend first, then she told me that our friend told her that I blocked her and im sure she told her other shady stuff that I didn't do. 
They told me too unblock her... I told them I won't ask them too believe me but I didn't block her they said our friend is saying the opposite. 
I then told them that all I want is for them is too stay friends with both of us and we should just leave this.  
they finally said ""won't being seeing you guys us much anywho"" i apologized but they just ignored me. i then told them i just wanted to stay friends with them nothing else but they left me on read so i got emotional and sent them they happy birthday video I worked on all day to post on what's app and told them sorry that i made drama then deleted my what's up. 
I feel so fake, I don't know why I over reacted like  a drama queen..at first I found a excuse but now I feel bad for not understanding what my friend was going through by getting stuck in the middle of her two friends.

I know i am at fault yet 
I honestly can't help but question why she lied and blamed everything on me ? 
I'm not innocent but I'm actually really disappointed at me and everyone for not being here for me even thou I always have been for all of them. 

I'm disappointed at me for actually realizing I never saw them as an actual friend / i saw them as a friend but I never trusted them maybe I didn't trust them enough for them to trust me/.  

I'm a bad person and I over react... I feel like shit since I keep blaming it on other ppl and I keep seeking pity and I act innocent.

3- we just expect a lot from our partner?

For those of you who kept on pressuring yourself and one another to commit suicide ... love me or hate me but let me give you two fundamental advices for the experince I know for now.

1. Be self sufficient, I mean care for yourself don't ever never be dependent on people circumstances, most importantly PEOPLE. I am not saying people are not important. I am just saying have the ability and the emotional strength to be able to cope with life's problems and lonliness. Its like the police men carry guns most times but they are also educated in some self defense methods for when the times comes that they don't have those equipments, not the best example but you know what I mean. it's no joke when people say you always have a choice.

2. The list of things you care about should be very small and I mean very very small, you shouldn't waste this very short life we have caring about how people react to what ever the fuck you feel like doing or what ever you falsly asumed has value in your life. Stop being sad or angry at petty things. Ask yourself if that is something you would regret at your death bed for not doing or having or saying.....

 wrote this nearly a year ago
and i was in a depressive state which i had some usual breakdowns often during this time, i wrote my problems away. now,i officially am great.i am thriving in every part of my life. either way i accidentally found my self in one of my writing  and had a flashback of that time which wasnt pretty and full of chaos. if u ask me now i wouldnt change a thing.
all those things that  happned made me buff up on my emotional intelligence.u might think most of ur problemsdont go away but it actually gets better so read it am ready to take ur insults and ur views.
 
""Six month ago I was different person I had my own opinions and a bit introvert.I moved at my own pace, I cared about my future my way of life,I use to save I had enough money to start a business and think about finding that one amazing girl . I forgot to tell you i am 25 years old male and I have a promising and respected  career ahead of me and I always believed I had a reason to do all of the things I do until the past six month. Now I am not motivated,not productive and i am a party animal and I get by In my education but I see a blankness that is waiting at the end and I depleted some of my money which I could have progressed on after graduation and also my definition of a girl has completely changed, am into no emotion based relations with ppl I had no intention of being serious with. I enjoyed them very much but I was always honest with them I luv that u can do this in our generation but it is also sad and childish. I became the guy who I use to despise and am in this unsettling state of mind. if u ask me all this would happen in a year. I would laugh at u so hard. it all started going wrong after we had to go to an educational attachment in a rural area at which time I hanged wiz freinds and ""met a person"" got close wiz a colleague we had  unforgetable memories she was amazing, charming wiz unbelievable personality and a great smile did i mention my favorite person. whom I liked and cared about. which in 2 weeks changed my un seemingly introvert way of life to an extrovert
If that cannot be the reason it means I have a  new alter ego which took over after this new exposure. long story short this amazing life  ended devastatingly and the wrong way from the expected. we went on distancing  ourselves now we're like anderomeda and milkway. I hope one day just like this to galaxy's we will be closer and be one even tho it's unlikely.i still wish that. That is not the point of this unbelievably long long writing i wrote in order to get over this one person.i wish this bring me solace from this emptiness i felt and still feel somtimes. I think i caused my own desolution  by being hard to be next to with no mind games and continious unconditional self giving ritual. which I thought it was about when u care about someone.i guess all I knew about this stuff was wrong or it just ddnt work out. but that wasn't the end of the story. after that I turned my self into a villain which caused her and some ppl pain and now I distanced everyone around me. before all this changes and dramas came I use to enjoy my loneliness now it is like am looking for ppl connection and approval everywhere and failing terribly.just not to be alone,i had simply different phases on my journey to know my self again. that happened so peeps don't be like me be smart keep ur emotional portion of urself hidden. i swear to you i have seen this coming four month ago. me writing this sitting at home.""

Hear me out. I am really into someone who, most probably, only talks to me or gets in touch when he has nothing to do or he’s bored. I’m not in love or anything, just addicted. To his mindset, his attitude, everything. That’s rare for me, I don’t go out much and don’t know that many people. From the ones I know, most seem not to “fit” to my lifestyle. So here I am, giving my everything to this dude which I don’t even know if he is in it with me for the long term. I don’t want to picture myself with another person. I’ve gone too far with him & i feel like he owns some part of me. Uff! The worst part is he literally shuts me out for daysss and that gets to me the most.

So I have had this frnd we've been good frnds for a little while now and we've always been a little flirty with eachother but she had a boyfriend so i never rly did anything. So like a few weeks ago she came over to study or whatever and things escalated. We were just fooling around in front of a mirror and she kissed me no warning totally took me off guard but i kissed her back we made out for a little while but it didn't go any further than that, that day. The next day she came over again with out telling me i tried to bring up the boyfriend thing but she brushed it off like like she's not with him rn after that things got physical and we hooked up this became a regular thing where we would just see each other at the library or wherever and we would hook up. I really like this girl she's just so effortlessly gorgeous ,kind and funny. But there's just a few things off one I still see her with her ex and noone knows about me and her exp my roommate (i can't rly ask her about it cuz we never talk like that) plus she's 22 and I'm 19 so there's a bit of an age gap.

It has been 3 months since we started talking but she has tried asking me to be her bf 1 month since we met and I have told her I don't want to be with her but she says she won't let go and will stay patient till I change my mind which I won't.

One quick question, would you leave someone you care about because that person is not giving you a 100 percent in terms of relationship, because of personal problems? Mind you, you care deeply for this person but the affection is not reciprocated rn, and it just feels off and draining to be there for someone constantly and not get anything back. I feel helpless.

Okay I’m kind of shocked. 
I’ve been reading some vents and honestly this generation has to be the DUMBEST and most USELESS of the generations we’ve had before. 

I mean literally 99% of y’all are venting about a boy/girl friend and how y’all want them to be all yours and how you can’t concentrate on any shit cause the love is way up your ass. I mean DAMN I wish all my problems were regarding some other human beings attention LMAO. 

The rest of y’all being depressed and shit. That’s some deep shit. Get help. Mental illness is not given much attention in our society and y’all shouldn’t let that fuck you up. The depression we see in the movies, the one we think is some kinda dark phase of life ain’t close to that. Please make sure of your mental state before making decisions. If we tell our brain that we’re unhappy and fucked all day everyday, then that’s what we gone be. This is called Garbage In, garbage out (google it).

This is a sequel of the vent about our generation being dumb and stuff. 

Okay so I’ve seen the comments and I really need to apologize because apparently the things that I’ve said are sensitive to others and I shouldn’t have addressed it that way. But there’s also a huge misunderstanding between what I was trying to say and what y’all thought I was saying. Hear me out. 

First of all, I’m not trying to be a smart ass. I was sharing what I felt, and it was judgmental and I’ve apologized for that. I mean I’m here to vent, and to read others and try to help out as much as I can 

Second, I NEVER said that mental illness (depression and so) is stupid. In fact, I was saying it’s far from stupid. It’s REAL. I’ve seen people being affected by it. Most of our society doesn’t understand mental illness, and that’s one of the main reasons why it’s getting worse. We should know how to get professional help. 
But sometimes, we all go through a dark phase in life. We would think that we’re “depressed” when we really are just riding on the roller coaster of life. So we continuously feed our mind negative thoughts, and it feeds us back the same thing ( as i said before, garbage in, garbage out). I’m just tryna say that we should know the difference between being in an actual depression or if we’re just temporarily sad. That’s all. 

Third, about the bf/gf thing, it’s true, who am I to judge. a problem is a problem no matter how small or big. Love is brutal, and I understand that. But it’s just unusual for 99 out of 100 people to share the same issue on relationships. I mean come on! I can’t say anything apparently my opinions are too insulting for you guys cause I’ve seen the comments and phew  that was a lot to take in.

Here is my confession 
I think the only reason only reason I’m alive is because I care too much about how the people would react upon my death.

I’ve been really depressed for the past 5 years or so and I don’t know really know why. I have a lot of friends and I’m pretty social. I don’t care if I die. If it were up to me I would choose not to live. I’m not going to kill myself though. I’ve got too much to live for. I want to make my mark on this world and not in a negative way. I’ve contemplated ended my life in the past but I thought about the emotional pain it would bring to my family and friends. They’ve all helped my through some tough times but it seems to be getting worse and I don’t know what to do. Recently, I’ve been distancing myself from them in the event that I do decide I don’t want to live anymore and it’s starting to make me more depressed. I know the sensible thing to do would be to continue to talk to them but as my life is progressing more of my friends are moving away and I don’t want to make new friends.

Hey there, its my first time venting so go easy on me. Well its more of something i need to say instead a vent. First of all I'd like to say, i believe in Jesus, am against gay people and am so not into sex before marriage. But probably half of you here read that and skipped to the comment section to insult me for believing in those things and the other half of you thought another teenager with an opinion, but then again i dont care thats probably why i kept writing cuz I've got some thing i need to say. A few days back i saw a vent that started with ""this generation is so dumb"" it got me so pissed of i want to say 4 things. Its long so bare with me.
1, all of us have something we believe in wether it's  something about religion,homosexuality or sex. we believe that we are right and we stick by it. Sometimes we believe in something we have never seen, like God. But being human gave as a quality of believing, we are not sure, we could be soooo wrong, but we believe it any way. So tell me what gives as the right to go up to people and insult them for believing in Jesus? What gives us the right to  insult people about being gay or having sex before marriage? When we are not even 100 % sure about it.
2, lets say we found this amazing coffee house and we probably cant wait to tell our friends about it, but even if after we tell them they keep going to the same crappy house they were going before.  Do u insult them for going to the crappy place or try to tell them the one you found is better? Ik the ideology dont make much sense but what am trying to say is you tell people that believe in homosexuality or sex before marriage that there wrong and tell the the better way but that does not give you the right to insult and undermine what they think is right. even after you tell them they stick to what they belive in then i just try to be there for them.if u are a geniune person u try to help not take away what they believe is true. Cuz are you 100% sure?
3, believe that your a sinner. Trust me the most judjmental person has the ugliest baggage.

Even if I put this as nicely as I can it still sounds terrible. I
hate my family. My moms side of the family is so mean!
My auntie likes to call me a screw up all the time, she
says my taste in music sucks and I am useless. My little
cousin follows her mom, she likes to call me names and
says pretty much all the time that I am worthless and
better off dead. My other cousin is no better either; he
says Im irresponsible and that I dont diserve anything
that I have. My uncle likes to call me fat and ugly. My
brother joins in and my mom doesnt defend me. Ive
told them many times to stop it, but Please stop it.
Turns to, Stop it! Then that turns into, Shut the f*****
up you **! And then I get in ****for swearing. I tell
my mom how much I dont get along with them and I
dont want to see them anymore because Im sick of
feeling like dirt, but she doesnt listen! She thinks being
stuck in a room with them for a few hours will magically
fix everything, but it just makes it worse! I try and try and
try to be better, and to stop being a screw up but its
never enough. I get enough bullying at school from the
boys in my classes I dont need my family making fun of
me on the weekends now. I feel like Im a voice unheard
in a sea of people who only love each other that Im left
out of. I dont know what I should do anymore, I feel like
an outsider in my own family. I dont belong anywhere.
People say they cry themselves to sleep once in a while, I
do it every night. Even when I had a good day I still cry
myself to sleep, I know no matter how happy I can be one
day itll all be taken away from me sooner then I want. I
dont like waking up in the morning saying, F*****
every day because I know something is going to happen
that will never make my day better again. Every since my
father died a few years ago Ive become more and more
withdrawn from everything. My classmates made fun of
me for not having a father (like I can control that!) and I
stopped going outside on weekends and weekdays. I
started to hate my classmates and took shelter from
everything in my life on the internet. The internet is my
home, my family, my love. My mom has taken the
internet away from me before and I cried to four days in
a row, I became very ill. I saw no point in living anymore,
nothing could regain my happiness without the one thing
that actually made me feel worth anything. Ive done that
more then once; I often get very, very, very ill when I get
too depressed. Now my body is just weak all the time,
any sort of sickness; a cold, flu, or just a runny nose that
goes around school or whatever I am the first to get it.
My family has also helped me to become suicidal, with all
this insulting from my peers and family Im either going
to grow up remembering a terrible childhood or Ill
probably just end up killing myself. I just dont know how
to make my life stop sucking so badly.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9990725517272949

First off, how do you deal with your family (parents and siblings and cousins mnamn) thinking you’re a player malet I didn’t do anything eko I just talk to guys but I never lead them on or anything its just brotherly sisterly keza it may get serious with one of them so I would just distance myself from the other guys. Does that really make me a player?

Second, I don’t get telegram I mean I used to talk to this guy and we got serious malet we talked everyday mnamn and miste bale mnamn eyetebabaln we were actually a thing (at least in my head) keza out of nowhere he distanced himself and he doesn’t text me anymore and I tried so many times but he always cuts the convo short and doesn’t seem interested so my question is: is this just a telegram thing and was it never serious (cos I did catch feelings eko) weys does the guy just have his own issues ena beka do I have to do anything, what do I do?",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9978639483451843

I am at an impasse in my life where it could go in two drastically different   routes. I have been struggling with depression for about 2 years now. I have contemplated suicide and I self harm. I have dealt with it alone because i had to put up this front of a normal person. I faked smiles and conversation while inside all i wanted to do was end it. I am not the person my family or  friends think I am. I am not the quiet person they know. I want anything but to be a burden on anyone so I keep it all to myself. And it is really stressful to always feel like a fraud when you are pretending to be okay. It has affected my social life and my classes too. I started distancing myself from friends because i was tired of explaining the scars and faking conversaions. And talking to my family is now a source of guilt when i compare who they think I am to who I have become. And it is very exhausting. But this story is not about giving up or losing hope. This one is of faith. I have strayed from my religion but it seems I can't do this all on my own so I am searching for something I lost. my faith in God. I have accepted that my depression and my problems won't just vanish. I don't want to give up on myself just yet but I am on very thin ice. I want to get better, work and be someone who can help others but right now I need it. My life is in ruins and i have just begun to pick up the pieces. I want to give it my all and fix it but the thought that it is too late and too broken to put back together holds me back. I am not even close to being a good person. I have been selfish and sometimes a jerk. I have lied and been unloyal but i know that is not all there is to me. I care and I want to do something good with my life.But if this one thing doesnt go right I think it is what will break me. I know it.

Betrayal. You didn't even feel the slightest remorse. You came into my life as fast as you left it running. I can not forgive you. You defiled our sacred relationship; you did this. I hate you for it. I don't understand your reasons nor do I accept any apology. I curse that day you left me for that thing. That piece of shit you called your lover. I saw you with it. I won't even humanize that thing. You did it; you let our year of love shatter in a minute. I loved you. I cared for you. I even fed you. Why did you have to go to it? You disgusting feline. I should have listened to my mother's rebuke. I should have stayed away. I shouldn't have left you alone in there. My friends say it's my fault. I shouldn't have trusted you. I thought you had some humanity left in you. What has our relationship come to? I can't trust you anymore. But what can I do. I love you too much to leave you. I fight for you when you're not around. I defend you to my family. I love you. Maybe I'm the fool. Maybe you were right to detach yourself from me. My life is too dull without you. I just want to vent this out.

Wow ,i was asking this to my self, how could some one lost his hope on humanity? I mean the way i see it, we are living here and now ena when ever some one is talking to u, it is not either ሳክስ or seek ur validation. It could also be an interest on what u think abt the situation. Which also is, his urge to live and including u at the same time.

u dont need to be nice and say what u think that makes him happy and have this moral high ground because this such state will blind u & push u to arogantly conclud, z world is full of either ሳክሰኛ or unconscious insecure people.
 what u missed here is u dont know what makes people really happy. u just know ur truth abt that situation. which might work & this could make the person momentarily  unhappy  because  he need to change his way of thinking or this will lead to further discussions 
Bt if u just tell them what u think that makes them happy and let it slide. They will definatly return becauses that didnt work.Which will lead to this vesious cycle of easy bandges and annoyance which will let u blow up one day & u will tell them how they are (how u think they are) 

Yeah yeah u might say what if i am not in the mood of discussion or exploration. yeah this happen to some bt there are some argoant motherfuck hu have always reason to lie ....there is no reason to lie there is just explaining of why u cant join in, period!!


I blame u for taking the easy way out(ስቆ ማለፍ),  i blame u for creating this viosious cycle by fooling others by being ሳክሰኛ because u took the easy way out to soon and blindly choose ስቆ ማለፍ (a complete lie) than faceing ur self through the conversion ahead that cconvinced others there liers in the world


When u have somthing to say silnce is a lie, because the moment  u sheilded ur self by being arrogant that u can whisper those around  away and that moment  creats a hole which will suck every potential of u changing to answer person 

Please human u dont know anything  u accept that be u here and know let fate decide 

U r the insecure shielded behind facade of coolness .

Ps- it is to u, hu had once slided opprtunity with laughter, u ego maniac lier, fuck you!, fuck you for ruining real connection and society.

So
I've vented before once, but that was awhike ago, things have changed since then, gotten better in some ways and worse in some.
Right now, I'm just feeling a bit lonely I guess, I don't have people to talk to anymore, and I miss that feeling of being wanted even though I took ot for granted before, it's kind of sad really.
And people just keep walking out, or pushing me away, and I  don't even think they realize it, it's just happening, and they're obvious to the fact that it's hurting me, so I just keep quite.
Things are starting to get to me now, even the slightest comments make me question my worth, my abilitu to conversate,
Today a teacher told another student how amazing they were at a subject I used to be the best at, and that made me question the value of my work, and what made me even more sad is that I cared so much, that I didn't  have enough confidence in myself to defend my own creativity,
I'm basically loosing faith in who I am and everyone around me just keeps proving me right.

You tell me not to rush it while choosing a guy? You tell me it's going really well with your gf? How do you think I would feel to hear that? How do you think I feel when I can't love other people because I still love you? Do you think I am okay with you having a gf? Do you really think there was never a relationship between us? You told me you loved me eko. I believed that. My heart never beat like that. I fell for you because you let me. You gave me hope. But now look at you forgetting all about me. I thought I was gonna be okay. But when? It has been 2 years and half. And I still believe I will move on. I don't think I ever will. I don't want the pain so please take it from me. Ende I'm not okay eko. What should I do when I can't stop thinking about you? What am I supposed to do when I can no longer tell you that I love you? You are not even that great. What have I seen in you that I can't get over it? I don't see where it went wrong. I thought we were gonna stay longer. How is it possible to forget all about you and love another person? I get so mad when I meet very cool guys and I can't date them because there is you inside. Make me hate you. Make me believe you never loved me. Make me lose hope on you. Give the pure heart I gave you back. Return it and let me love another person. I'm too weak to handle this. I'm shading tears while writing this.

I wondered why I keep forcing myself to forget you and move on. why it is so easy for me to give up on us. It was because I was scared of being in pain, of putting myself out there and getting hurt. And so I construct this reality to support my arguments. I listen to those that tell me waiting is foolish, that fairy tales happen only in movies. But if I am honest with myself I know every drop of pain is worth it if it means I have a shot at being with you. As ludicrous as it seems that i would ever see you again I can't stop loving you. I have just as much a shot of putting the pieces of my life back together as this has of panning out. So I have nothing to lose either way.It is not a pleasant wait. It hurts to miss you and  a bit more when you are the first thing I think of when i wake up But still I am a perfectionist and I can't give up the perfect I found in you. After you everything would seem crooked like there is something missing. And there are no guarantees that the second time we would be forever. Still i'd rather try than you be the one that got away. And if writing in the middle of the night to convince myself to get over my fears is what is gonna take then that's what I will do. And when i  see your smile again all those thoughts and fears will vanish. it will be as if they never happened because you would have been worth it.

This is not your usual vent but I encourage everyone to read it. I have seen a lot of 'I''m depressed' vents and read the comments which are mostly not helpful. I don't think we Ethiopians get the seriousness and the prevalence of depression. First of all to say that a person is depressed, he must fulfill a number of criteria which I will not get into detail here but If anyone is interested, I will gladly explain via private texts or another vent. And if a person does have depression, he/she must go through different kinds of treatment not like the ones that have been commented in here like 'get a life' , 'read a book'.....like seriously......at least try googling  about depression and knowing more about it.

The cure 
Most of you are trying to confirm answers and trying to make the group make the decision for u. But your life is ur responsibility.  U have to own that n make a choice u think be fits u. 

Some of you r stuck in d past,  seasoning urselves in d past pain. The past is as gone as d dead. Don't let ruin ur now.  I know it feels good n easier to lay around n cry but life will get boring n lame. Ur at ur present. Live now for an awesome tmr. 

Y'all young.  Really young. Stop acting like y'all 70 year old grandparents hu regret der lives. Ur growing up. N a part of growing up is learning from experience. The other part is finding ur purpose( be it passion.. Talent.. Anything) n sticking to it. 
In psychology, during building personality,  there is teenage years. These years are where u will have two opposite ideas fighting for ur attention n it's okay. That is nature working out ur personality with time,  don't be afraid. 

Nobody is worth anything but everybody is worth sty. That value comes emanates from n washes over every other person around u. Before anything be d person u wanna be. 

U say ur lost. But all I see is ppl scared to take d road they know is right. 

Life is a paradox. Try to forget sth n u will never forget.  Try to move on untouched n u will be stuck obsessing. What u can do is change ur focus. N DAT is hard,  a lot of effort will be needed. Be strong.

I mean what's wrong with ye Addis Ababa lijoch these days?
I'm a 19yo girl born and raised in Addis. So my question is where the hell did this generation learn to disrespect people's identity, like where did that come from? Growing up I know we all made fun of people's names or their fathers. I mean  I made some bad jokes and some were made on me too,because of my father's name, but I thought that was as far as we all would go. Where the hell did that disrespect  come from? Our generation was supposed to be better eko. We're the ones who grew up exposed to diversity unlike our elders.
Why the hell do y'all (The ones from Addis) find it so hard to accept diversity I mean what's wrong with loving what you are? Y'all just go like ""Ye sheger like fiker yelewem zer... Ethiopia tekdem ..."" I mean having no ethnicity is a choice and you have all the right in the world to live like that, but using this to insult others and call them Fara mnamn mn ametaw? You chose not to have ethnicity they chose to have one, I thought it was a choice. Some of us are raised speaking other languages, listening to the history of our ancestors and singing their traditional songs. It's a part of who we are. It defines us. If weren't imposing our culture on people and doing our own thing why should anyone give a damn about what we do? It's irritating betam people comment even on the smallest things. These days I find it so hard to share things with my friends. Like on facebook, once I posted a status update it was just an innocent ""listening to..."" Status update and it got my friends all up like ""yehen kanchi antebekem mnamn"" Mndn new matetebekut? Me listening to something That's not Amharic? Why is everyone so sensitive when it comes to ""Bher"". 
I think people reacting this way to pushes others more endawem eko. I know people who were so chill about ethnicity mnamn stuff and changed betam because of the disrespect they saw. . .

Some word of advice
When life drags you down beats you to the ground sticks your face in the mud pulls you cloth off and put lava on your feet never and i mean never think of the easy way out (sucide, giving up) 

‼ Easy choice  =  very hard life awaits
Make the hard choice now  =  easy life awaits you 
This is one basic life cycle i wish to share from my experience
 
I don't know about your religion but i know a true quote that says God challenges those he loves sometimes i get jealous with some venters i wish God could test me too with humangous challenges. 

Those who crunch their teeth and use their hands to crawl their way out of that mud and lava  are going to be stronger than titanium braver than belay

Trust me their is allways and i mean allways a choice in opposite to giving up. 
 
 For all venters with real problems may your faith help you through all your problems. 
 Remember you are  lovely and freaking amazing hehe you are the only one that's you eko. 
 And lastly shout out to the people who are consuming their time to support others.

My behavior is something not many people can deal with. Most people have learnt it the hard way, but those who still exist in my life have learned to accept it. I'm a junior now and I've survived heartbreak depression, suicide attempts and a lot of other emotionally traumatic things. But I'm still here :) Leaving all that behind I got a boyfriend that not only loves me but can handle me to some certain extent. And I appreciate that he's trying but sometimes he himself can act like me, and it makes us argue alot. And lately our arguments are really intense, we don't speak anymore during school hours and our texts are constant fights.

OK this is rlly messed up I have been in a relation ship with this amazing guy for 5 years now and I love him so much that I would do anything just to make him happy he means the world to me. but when we first started going out even though I lived him I never had time for him or school came first and all the point is I loves him but was never willing to show that to him but at some point I realized that he's my priority and all but I think I'm too late for that  cuz now we're kinda drifting apart when we're together the rest never mattered but then still things are changing and I got a text from him that he needs time and space cuz I have hurted him .....

A message to a girl from S.W.A. Hey, It's been a while since I last talked to you. You've blocked me on TG and hung up my calls, and now You've changed your number too! When we broke up, you told me that you had only been dating me to forget about your former ex, and I replied that I was also using you for sexual gratification. But we both know that I was lying when I said that. I loved you more than I gave a rat's ass about my family, or even myself. And I still think of you daily and check out our shared media like the fucking obsessive ex that I am. I know we are miles apart and you have your future as a doctor or whatever to think about. But do you really feel complete without me? I know I don't. I admit I've been intimate with other girls since we left each other (it was a mutual agreement to break up), but now I feel so lost and lonely without you. I know I can't go back in time, but if anyone out there invents time travel, I'd be sure to use it and get you back. I don't want to sound pathetic or desperate, but the other girls I saw after you were boring and had a much less sense of adventure, and all I want is you. I just want this message yo reach you somehow and for you yo realize that people make dumb mistakes and that they are capable of maturing in time. The last song you referred to in our texts was ""Back to you"" by Selena Gomez. And so, I would love to come back to you, babe. Just call me and I will apologize profusely, if that's what you truly desire. I wish we could dance at your graduation like you said we would.",love,NEGATIVE,0.9598039984703064

Okay, this happened to me almost three years ago but it has always bothered me thinking about it. There was this strage feeling i was feeling the whole time. It's like I was not alive, and it's like i was not dead either. It felt like i was living in between. It was sort of feeling dizzy, but that was not exactly it. I don't even know what it was to be honest. I felt scared, non-existant, and dizzy all at the same time. This feeling of mine stayed for like 3 or more months.

Honestly, why is all this frenzy behind Adwa victory?
Yes, it was a good battle; but we always hide oursleves from the fact that Italians where only 20000, with 10000 askaris and many of them didn't use the advanced technology at the time as Antonelli told the ruler of Italy that its enough.
Our 'independence' granted Sudan colonization after 17 years of struggle at Omdurman in 1898 against Britain. Britain learned from Italy that don't underestimate black people by not using proper tools.

There's this one problem. I'm really jealous of this one dude she spends so much time with. This guy was one of my closest friends, and also was friends with her too but not at the time when we started dating. After we did start dating they got wayyy to close. She'd quickly hang up the phone on me the second he called her, and so many other things she'd do that would hurt me. See what bothers me is that both of them used to have previous feelings for each other. Guys I can't tell u how much my hurt aches when these to spend so much time around each other. I talked to my girlfriend about it and when she saw how hurt I was she did say she's gonna stop being this close but it happened again and she said she doesn't care because she needs people to talk to in her life and that I should trust her.

""Sooo? "" they start to ask....  ""tell me about your crush?"" 
""crush?"" I say,  "".... I never really had a crush.... ""
And it's at this point, ladies and gentlemen, they start looking at me funny. ""What?"" I go.  They narrow their eyes, raise that one suspicious eyebrow and with a smirk go ""you liar. That's SOOO not true. NEVER? Yeah...  Pffffft.  No way!"" 
 I mean,  from way back when, I was not big on unrequited love.  I just couldn't see myself wasting my heart over someone that might not even know I exist, pining over my lost Romeo, fantasizing about how him and I could be the next big thing or almost fainting when he smiled at my direction or dream of holding his hands or plotting away my scheme of making him love me or writing our names in bright little red hearts or .... (okay that might be too far fetched ) but seriously.... 
I mean,  okay look,  I might fancy a guy of two and find it a little harder to hold a straight face conversation with or look straight in the eyes or whatever, I mean,  I'm not a robot.  but that feeling goes away fast and I start treating 'em like all my other guy friends. And it goes even faster, more like dissipates, if I find that they have a woman.  I just don't see whining over someone I can't have nor should have. 
But they (the 'they' that asked if I had a crush) think not having someone in my school, work, or anyplace that I like makes me a cold hearted, inexperienced person that doesn't know how to love.  
Really?     Really??  And you do? You who goes out of their way to have their dream man doesn't give a rat's ass who you hurt?  You who cried like a baby who's denied his chew toy when he doesn't want your catfishing ass, you who play games and lie and pretend for your crush to notice you?  You KNOW love?  Haa! Pffft! Hmph! Yeah, of course you do.  The world needs more of us that are like you right?  Suuuure....  
Girls, please. Let's just be better than that, huh?  That's not love. That's obsession.

So heres the thing I'm 20 years old and I've been seeing a girl thats a little bit older than me(23). At first the age thing never came up but at her birthday i found out she was it was surprising but i was completely fine with it and so is she. But months later i started noticing things about us that's a little different from other couples.I'm med skl but she already graduated and has a pretty good job so she  NEVER let's me pay for anything anymore. I rly didn't mind that at first but now it feels weird and we end up fighting about it non stop. Another thing is that she worries too much about everything all she wants to talk about is how my classes are going or who I've been hanging out with menamen and that being coupled with the age thing rly makes her seem like more of a mom than a gf. That being said i still find her super attractive and all the the chemistry is there but this rp dynamic is not healthy. Or am i just over thinking this?",confusion,NEGATIVE,0.9951785802841187

Hey there everyone its my first time venting here. I don't know what I have actually if its depression or anger or maybe something else. I just feel angry most of the time without a reason even when someone says hi to me and I have no fuckin clue what to do. Don't tell me to go see a therapist or something cause I can't open up to anyone even my closest friends and family & I really can't focus on my classes either and I'm 12 grader this year so I'm afraid I will fail the exam and screw my fuckin life so if u have any advice please.",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9996631145477295

Lately i’ve been thinking about him a lot and I know he’s hurt me but he loved me too and me ending things without even explaining well probably made him hate me. Im sorry biye rasu aywetalgnm I swear this has been on my mind 24/7 for like the last two weeks. I want to tell him how sorry I am because he deserves at least to know why I wanted to end things. It was something we could’ve easily fixed if we could talk about it but I rushed and gave up on us.

I thought it would hurt more  when you said "" I hate you"". I was relieved that you saw me just as I see myself. I told you I would ruin it. I spoke from. experiance but you wouldn't listen and I couldn't stop. I kept coming because I knew you'd be there. I've never had that not for this long anyways. Someone I wouldn't have to pretend for. I could be me and still you cared. Naturally it couldn't last. Every good thing I destroy. you were just the next incarnate. I was numb to the pain. It got drowned out by the demons in me. It was too late to go back. I knew I had somone now. And so   when it was all consuming you were my only light. But it was too deep to illuminate. And it devoured what we had until hate was left. I am not surprised  but it's still disappointing. We'll probly never see each other again and I am happy for you. Maybe next time you will use me to know what to steer clear of. I wish you the world. I will never love anybody like I did you. I was just lost in my head. It's okay tho.

 ""Scientific enquiry has brought immeasurable benefits. But at the same time, it has left many feeling a spiritual void. By eliminating gods and the afterlife, the scientific picture of the universe seems to have sapped individual human lives of any special meaning; we fit in only as mere organisms, living out our brief lives for no reason, and then perishing. This, he suggests, is the source of the ultimate insecurity, the one that underlies all the others. Yet retreating back under the comforting wing of the old, doctrinaire religions isn’t an option for most of us; you can’t re-convince yourself of claims
that you know are untrue. Are we stuck, then, with the choice of living meaningless but scientifically truthful lives, or lives based on superstition and self-deception?""",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9982848763465881

Hey unihorse
Hide my identity
I need to vent
I like my life, I know I am luckier from most. And I seem like I live a perfect life. But its far from it. I used to be fat as a kid, so naturally I was bullied. I saw a suicide when I was in the second grade, hanged. I saw a kid get stabbed and bled to death during a fight when I was in the 5th grade. My best friend died of cancer in the 7th grade. My grades dropped. Developed an eating disorder in the 9th grade. My parents r sick of each other so they make excuses of business trips so they won't be at the house at the same time. I started dating but I hated it, and I started drinking, smoking, popping pills and literally doing every drug available. Now I feel nothing most of the time. I think about nothing. I feel so numb I cut myself to feel something, anything. Pain is welcome. I overdose, drink, smoke till I can't stay conscious no more. And when I'm sober I can't sleep. I just stay wide awake all night. I have anxiety and panic attacks and I hate my self. I started dating this guy who knows a lot about me, not everything, but enough and he says he loves me.

Hello people
I really need some advice with something. Solutions...i need solutions.
Im a 1st year uni girl and few months ago a lot has changed about me. Shit happened in the past so i rly wasnt into dating and stuff so i have been avoiding or ignoring whatever comes to my way...related to dating i mean. But lately, a guy came into my life and changed all that. He liked me and tried his fuckin best to make me feel the same way. I repelled, as usual but not for long. Baam he got me. Been 2 months now since we got together. But then i started feeling insecure, not that he will like other girls more than me or sth..but that im not good enough so his feelings will fade away. So i try to be the  perfect  girl that can do anything he might want me to..or kind of like that. On the way i lost myself and now i havent succeeded on being that girl and i cant be myself...the girl that he fall in love with. Now he is always bored...doesnt talk as he used to...all the stuffs we used to talk about arent that much of subjects anymore. So im waiting for the day he's gonna say its over or i dont like u anymore. Its eating me inside..thats all i can think of..i read old texts and miss the old us and get even more scared. I miss him...i miss the guy that tries his best to make me laugh...who talks about silly stuff...who is always there for me when i need him. I dont feel any of those right now. Im scared. I cant do anything properly cause thats all in my mind
What should i do? Is this a phase that we might get over? 
Please tell me something",nervousness,NEGATIVE,0.9988419413566589

I don’t even know how to say this properly, if it’s worth anyone’s time, or if anyone can relate. I’ve noticed I’ve got a compiled anger and rage caused by different factors and it keeps adding up and I don’t even know how to handle it properly. School gives me anxiety and I’m about to graduate soon. I know a lot of people, hangout with most of them... but still feel lonely even around them. I can’t talk to them about it because then they’ll just act better out of pity. People come to me when they need something, I’m always checking up on them. Makes me think if I’m not good enough for them or anyone, because apparently “I’m too nice” for them.

So this is it huh. Those life defining moments I saw in movies where it was never the same again. I thought it would be more exciting but then again it is different when you have an idea of what’s to come and it just becomes about whether or not you are ready for it. If you can live with it and build yourself a new. I guess this is what it feels to be schrodinger's cat. I am both alive and dead, I am both hopeful and hopeless, I am both lost and set with a new purpose. How i wish that daim cat lived right now. I mean they do have 9 lives so the odds are good. I have so much life and love in me. I know it ! I do. I let my fears bully me in to this tiny box i barely fit in. i was lulled to sleep by the safety of the now and cast my ambitions aside. I forgot who i was and became someone who is constantly trying to outrun both the past and the future. I became a zombie sleepwalking through life. I was in  a haze when the wrecking ball  destroyed all that i loved. I left myself with nothing but my anger and hate to keep me company. I tore through their kindness like it was nothing. I trampled on their faith and used them to my liking. I didn’t know how to speak only to scream. I didn’t know how to ask for help. I found my drugs in every corner. I shot them up and rode the high until my bones were shattered from the fall. I knew there was no way out but i kept on running. I ran until my feet gave out but i fell  short. I found myself staring at who i have become. This mask of mine is tired coming apart at the seems. I had worn it for so long my true face felt foreign. As if i woke up one day to be this empty pretender. I don’t want to hate anymore. I don’t want to hurt anymore. And for that i would hurt a thousand times over. The two halves of me have found a way to coexist for the moment. I feel hope that this would be my turning point and i feel hopeless that this is my curtain call. So i sit and ponder what could have been but sooner or later i have to face the music. So open the box, am i dead or am i alive?",desire,NEGATIVE,0.9956169128417969

Now I have joined campus and all the situations that I see, seem as if I haven't been living before, I mean I am facing things that I do not used to and I am in a real emotional crisis.

Hey. So I wanted to ask sth. I met this guy on Facebook like 3 years ago and we've been talking ever since. He's a good person and we talk about our family relationships school literally anything. The thing is he thinks we're best friends but I really don't feel like that. I talk about stuff like exams mnamn enji I've never really opened up to him. It's the same from his side to he has never really opened up and talked to me. We call each other sometimes and talk over the phone but it's just the same old ""how are you?, How is school?"" Mnamm. He says it's about time we meet but I don't really want to meet him. For starters I'm not that confident about my social skills. Online I'm this Weregna person but in person I'm kind of awkward around people I don't know and it takes me bezu gize to get comfortable with people. I don't even say hi to my classmates menged lay salf. Another reason is once we were talking about meeting and I explained how it would be awkward and we would end up not talking at all, and he mentioned that we're just meeting as friends. The thought of dating him has never crossed my mind I always assumed we were good friends and that he felt the same, but now that he has mentioned this I just couldn't help but think he somehow thinks of me that way. He's a very nice guy and I'm just not interested. Plus when you talk to someone online you have this picture of what the person would be like I'm pretty sure the picture he has is way different than my appearance, I look better in pictures and I happen to have Des yemil demts over the phone so I don't think I can live up to his expectations. Meeting a friend beha bihon his expectations matter ayaderg yehonal but now that the thought that he might be interested in me has crossed my mind I kept thinking about my appearance, I really don't know why I care because I'm really not interested in him.
But anyways I keep avoiding every chance that comes up. I feel like a bad person for doing this. I really hate the idea of meeting him in person but he's been asking me to meet him for about a month now o don't know how to explain my situation without sounding like a complete jerk.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9973316192626953

I really don't care about you but maybe this is one of the selfless things I do is this vent. I have seen vents students posting ""Oh my God, my grade is bad"" ""I was distracted by this chick that my rank is ruined"" well boo fucking hoo, well I had good grades when I graduated from high school I got to the ""best""(AAU) University in Ethiopia learned probably the ""best"" field and my friends in other very competitive fields where smart people supposedly join. We got good grades from University. 
Only to realize non of it mattered, being hired will only cause you a slower death than being unemployed were your parents will be the ones killing you; by thier annoying remarks and daily naggings reminding you that your not good enough and will compare you to the hired neighbor living next door but only to find out that he is more depressed than you and knowing he is wasting his potential by making someone else richer. 
Well what I am trying to say is, you are Millinials! The new ""lazy"" generation where everything is handed to you that you don't want to work hard a day in your life. Our parents generation got rich in the analog world(the ones that got rich, or survived there of) but we can dominate in the new world,the tech world. 
Conclusion: none of it matters. Your grades, your rank. I don't even think you should go to college, only the skills you gather matter. Learn coding, learn something related to computers that's the only place you have a chance. That's the ugly truth.

 Have you ever felt like the world is always against you. Moments you just want to disappear. And never look back. A Lot of emotions bottled up over the years, you just don't know how to get them out. Anger, frustration and stress. Distance yourself from people. Build a wall so high, no one would dare to break through. Hurt by expectations. But you put up a front. A front that gets people going like ""aye that guy is happy"".

But you know as the pressure builds my walls break and now I'm thinking wether to shove pills down my throat or just not go to school anymore. I just really hate everything and everyone now. I'm always at fault for some reason.

It's very strange to fell in love and to be heartbroken in just 30 minutes. Even worse we went out clubbing together and damn I haven't heard a single word that u hv said I was too busy trying not to stare at ur sexy lips. We danced and I grinded on u I felt u and then I stoped I don't wanna feel sad for her.....Months pass with me fighthing off ma feelings and staring at ur pic everyday. I wished for us to text, go out, meet up. And then I heard u broke up with her I was the happiest creature alive...but then again I cudnt make a move. I even lost weight. Ma friends where rlly worried abt me. One night I promised to ma self to never think of u and guess what an hour later u texted...strange very strange but I calmed ma self and texted u back. Days later u took me out and then suddenly u stoped texting.....am not mad or surprised.

Guys I’m not here to Vent but to ask for Help. I am sure most of you heard the story a girl who went to China and was falsely accused and arrested for drug possession. She is a friend of mine who went to high school with me and is facing a death penalty in China unless we help share the story through social medias Facebook and signing the petition so that our Ethiopian government could take this matter seriously and send officials over there to help her get a fair trail to say the least. Please search for Nazrawit Abera and share whatever you get on social media and tell your friends as well! It would really help out spread the word.

I see a lot of vents where everyone sees all the bad things in their life but to some degree everyone has bad things happening to them and they are just good at hiding it and smile through it and all i wanna say is we should atleast try to appreciate what we have in life because the more we complain and hurt ourselves the more these problems comes i know that from experience.

Thinking back to the times that have been the most special, the most exhilarating and the most damn fun, they’re the times when I’ve been bouncing around a room full of good people, just doing what I do best. Laughter matters to me.  Being silly matters to me. Being with good people matters to me.

So how did it happen that I’m at a place in life where I spent my Birthday (and a lot of other days to boot) alone for the last few years? How did I get to a place where I can go days where the only conversation I have is with myself? How did I get to be more alone than ever?

I’ve noticed the lack of human contact impacting my energy levels, my enthusiasm about things and even how I perceive my own feelings. The whole thing alarms me and disappoints me, and all of this is potentially more damaging than anything I could set out to do intentionally.

I’ve been in a long distance relationship for a little over three months now. This is my first ever relationship so as you can imagine, having it be long distance on top of that has been a pretty confusing experience. My boyfriend is extremely sweet and he is quite literally the picture perfect boyfriend. I know he’ll always be there if I ever need him and he just treats me so well. But in the past three months my feelings have been stagnant and they have not developed to be any stronger towards him. He’s always treated me with care and love, he always tried to be there for me and I have never really gotten that from a man, I had a shitty father who was never there for me. And I feel like going into the relationship I might have compromised my feelings because I felt like I wouldn’t get that kind of treatment from another man. And now idk what to do because I definitely don’t feel for him what he feels for me. Any advice?

He is the only one I came out to and he has been very accepting. We Have had our moments too. Couple of makeups and we've exchanged blow jobs.  But thing is there's more of my baggage than this. I sometimes feel like a girl. I put on makeups and dress like a girl. And he's okay with that. But when I told him I might be a closeted trans he flipped and never answered  my  calls.

I'm struggling to find the motivation to study 
And I dont see any discipline in my life 
Like everything is all over the place 
And it's very depressing for me 

Like when I was in Islamic school, discipline was kind of easy. I'd wake up at like 6, pray and get ready to go school. I'd be in school from 8:30 till like 4:15 and I'd arrive home again by like 5:15 -30 ish. Then I'd eat and sit down in the spare living room to learn Quran for the next day. My parents took out the sofas and stuff and had these custom mattress type things on the floor. And I'd recite till like 8ish and the rest of the day was mine. Maybe It doesn't go to plan every single day but that was like 90%. I'd sit like morning and evening on Saturday and Sunday too. 
Like I feel even though it was dry, there was some sort of structure. The main thing ig was pressure from strict parents 

But now I find myself doing the randinest shit all the Time and never studying. I'd planned for a complete revision of Quran and even extra things, but none of that seems to stick. 

The thing that gets to me also is that the year Is basically finished and so there's even less motivation to fix things

Hello, I guess. 19. Freshman.
It's a common thing to hear from a discussion about cannabis that it's used to treat ADHD. Although there's no scientifically proven fact for this, it's widely accepted opinion. Yes. In some cases, time slows down, everything has fluid sensation and the surrounding becomes calm, heightened observation skills and understanding makes it a lot easier for anyone with ADHD to be stable and focused. But in the long run, none of this is confirmed. So, if anyone has any experiences or ideas on usage of cannabis in terms of temporarily ceasing ADHD, please stand up?",approval,NEGATIVE,0.9887718558311462

Esti stop and listen, can't u hear the unstoppable marching of time which is slowly guiding us all towards an inevitable DEATH.

 no no no i am thinking this to much i need to concentrate on what i have and work hard, meaning blind my self until i have more money, to buy more things, to see more places and that will create this joy which basically nothing but chemicals dancing inside this flesh ,

but i could love someone and that in return. Yeah that is better now i can fool my self from remembering this  void of non existence by another urge from my body to continue it self. 

Or i should just shut z fuck up and stay alive because every body is doing it. Awo they are doing it because they might have reasons that i dont understand or maybe they are doing it cause others are doing it or  they are doing it to numb themselves from the absurdity of non existence.

Come on! I need to have faith in God. he knows better,so i need to wait. Bt better how? Happier? Healthier? ,What the fuck are those? Just an irony which i will get when this all end or maybe this will never end ...and not to mention some of the shits feels like freaking badly written sci-fi which are very paradoxical with themselves

I met this beautiful girl because of my cousin, she is a friend of her. And we started talking then I like her she is awesome and smart and doesn't give a shit abt how she do things and the people's feedbacks, owww I liked that abt her, then I took her on a date and it went well, then again for a couple of time we went out have dinner and bla bla, u know, then one day she called and I met her and that day we started relationship, I guess I can call it that. And I was happy I knew she liked me, and we had an amazing weak and then she started pushing me away, I couldn't understand why? I asked, she said ""u r mean and I don't wanna be wrecked buy a man and I feel u would do the same to me"". .
I didn't know what to say, I remember telling her abt my past relationships and she was judging me in every situation I took a guess that it couldn't matter for her but it did, and the second reason she said ""I can't stand u being my best friend's Cuz I feel so weird when ever I kiss you and everything"" ohhhh that I didn't expected and she also said  ""I'm ur karma for what u have done in ur life "" and she left, that hurts so bad,
I never had a trouble of getting a girl gen I still think abt her, I'm so mad that she left because of what I did in my past relationships and my Cuz,

It's just that am not HAPPY I mean it when I say am not HAPPY even tho u would swear that am the happiest person alive if u knew me but am not I feel that am useless, a waste of oxygen.. the doctors told me that I have to see a physiatrist and they are right cuz till now am not regretting the attempt so better if I went there so this is just the highlight of my story till then just know that it's true when they say that people that laugh the most got a lot of pain that only him/her and their creator knows",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9658281803131104

I think some relationships (or most I see around me) are overrated.
""What do you mean?""

Well, I'm a second year guy. But I didn't go through highschool chasing a girl after another girl... You know? And I still am not.
""Are you saying you're gay?""
 
Wtf no!  What is wrong with you?
""Then explain yourself, boi!""

It's just that, when ever I think about it, it just becomes so damn pointless. I believe in love, I really do! I also believe that somehow, everyone has a perfect path to find their true love. 
""What's your point? You're sounding like an ancient philosopher.""

Alright, my point is that, why be with someone if you can imagine an ending to your relationship? If you like the sexual thrill of it, you shouldn't be like ""Oh he broke my heart "" BOO HOO! Girl you know dat boi ain't gonna stick around, finish school, get a job, take care of you, marry you, buy yourselves a house, make some kids, and live with you forever. Otherwise I don't think there's ever a point to it. WEY DEMO? ""Oh I like the fact that he performs well when we have our alone time (y'all know what I mean)"" and then when you find him cheating, you sob on your bed make that pillow all wet with your tears.  And I look at you like, what the f are you doing? Get yo ass up and go to school. Go.
 I mean I feel like some of you are gonna be like ""Oh this is way more complicated than you think!""
But, is it?  Then I need something.

 To the new trend followers of athiesm and/or to the porn, sex, drug, unfaithful life ridden depression inflicted brothers and sisters 

Hello! Im M.
Isnt that unbounded free life of doing what ever you want nice? Right?!! 
So when your told you need to abandon that life style because the bible demands it and you cant because the other side is boring and well... Its completely different. So if you deny that side your mere free living conscious will judge you soooo...what the heck... There is no God !! So you try to back your new notion by Googling this and that to consummate your new belief with your small and probably naive mind of yours. 
While some of you hide behind religion and stave off any such attack by your conscious and say ""im a follower of this and that religion so im granted the card to do what ever i want"". 
So the minute depression knocks the door all you think about is the rope. Afterlife eludes you. You use google as your instruction on how to cope with things. But not the bible because even though you know deep inside it has the answers you wont take it because your consciously dirty and your enjoying your drugs and sex and the free life. Stop lying to your self! Fear is nothing compared to hell. Drugs, sex, fornication are nothing. Dont go the longer route of faith into thinking there is no God and you happened by accident. Your parents may love you may be till death and so may your friends. But no one will die for you even when you hated him like Jesus Christ. He died and descended to hell in your place. He bailed you out! You dont need to live this life because you will be denying the free gift. Im not writing about no religion. From one former atheist, depressed person to another.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9900211691856384

I wish you know that it was me posting all this vents. I wish you know that I haven't moved on yet. It would have been very nice if you knew I am in pain. I would really like it if someone else could tell you about how I feel and so you can talk to me. I just can't tell you. I can't forget you. And it hurts when the pain has become part of you. It's there, it hurts but you are used to it. You probably don't know this feeling because you are seeing someone you love. I wish you were the administrator of the channel so that you can see my identity and talk to me about everything.

There was this guy i met at a work training. We have been talking since then. He says he loves me n wanna marry me n have kids. He is so sure abt me n ol. I started liking him.Things were goin well until he raised an issue of sex. He believes it is a must to know each other sexually before getting married. He said one of us might have a natural sexual problem(which i don know wat it means). And he said we have to have sex n check if we are a good match for each other. 
But i am a christian n i have a no sex b4 marriage rule. Told him so. Now he is pushing me to change where i stand. N my defense was since am a virgin girl there wud be no physical inconvenience that may make me unable to please my man. The only sexual problem i know is rectal dysfunction on guys. So i told him if he doesnt have that we r good to go. Even if zer r some issues, we can communicate n solve it. But he insists on havin sex b4 marriage. I told him to go away n cut him off. Did i do z right thing? N r there any such things like natural sexual incapabilities on a girl?

Have you ever loved someone so much that it leaves you in pecies wondering how they managed to put you back together. And when it ends it leaves a crater in your chest that nothing can fill. When they are your first thought and your last and each time you have to convince yourself that it really  is over. This ebb and flow of pain becomes the rhythm to your new reality. It hurts so much it makes you wish you never met them. The worst part is not that they left but that they showed you a version of you that could be so happy you thought you could do anything. Maybe you were too much for them. To many pieces to sort through to find somthing good. And maybe they deserved better and you this. This suffocating numbness to all but them. Reality feels like it's volume has been turned down. What once concerned you is now but a white noise. And no one dare come close to how you felt about them. So much that it makes you angry when they try. It seems never ending. Feeling like a part of you is missing. Walking incomplete knowing you'll never be whole again. Maybe it will take the world to fill what they left hollow. So you run and run.

I remember celebrating your 8th birthday. We were so happy. Then you enrolled in my school the next year. Everyone loved you. I remember how we fought as kids but always made up. Our parents were involved sometimes. But we grew out of it and we started to joke and play I was uptight and you helped me loosen up. We shared everything. There was nothing I would have not done for you. I loved you so much. I still kinda do even after all the things you have put me through. I get angry and sad but I think I understand why you felt like you had to do it. From the surface it seemed like I had it all and you wanted whatever you thought I had. I didn't want to believe it but I got my proof and now Idk how to go back. But I know all good things come after forgiveness so I forgive you. I forgive everything you have done and you continue to do to me. I refuse to get angry about the past. I refuse to let my story be about how I was your victim. God has given me a chance and it's all in his hands now. I wish you the best my dear. And everybody that has turned your back on me, I forgive you. I forgive you for letting me down and making me feel alone. I am grateful for him cause he has been kind and patient to me and he is what I need, at least for now.

Three years ago I met this girl, we connected immediately. She’s beautiful, smart, funny.I was so happy I found the girl of my dreams. We started dating, and in the middle of our relationship something that always happens to me. I get this feeling of being trapped when I get too close to someone. Ive had this problem even with most friendships bewnat.I can’t help it I just feel like I need space, and most people don’t understand that.The more they try to talk to me the more distant I become,and I’m talking about my closest friends here.So I stopped talking to her and she panicked,she thought I didn’t want to continue dating her.She tried so hard to make things work but I wouldn’t let her.And finally she stopped trying. I didn’t mind at first, I thought WHEN I’m ready, things will go back to normal. But she stopped trying after some months, so I tried texting her.She’d reply sometimes but you can tell it’s just to be nice and not cause she was interested like before.But even then I acted cool about it because I thought if I tried hard enough she’d come back.About a year passes by and I see her with another guy.That’s when I freaked out! So I tried calling, texting. Anything to get her to talk to me, she answered sometimes but I felt like I lost my chance. So I explained everything to her, I told her how hard it is for me to get close to people and that I’ve never loved anyone like her.She told me she genuinely loved me, but she’s really moved on.Ive bottled this inside all this year and I regret it from the bottom of my heart!I had an amazing girl and I let her walk out of my life. All for absolutely nothing.I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes thinking about her and all this.I mean she loved me!There was a point she’d do anything for me,and I gave that up.What did I get in return?Why didn’t I simply force myself to explain my situation when it mattered?Time heals pain but not regret.I have another girlfriend now but nothing seems to help.I know there is nothing I can do,I simply wanted to put my thought in words",sadness,POSITIVE,0.9247303605079651

Ok so try and read dis for me my beloved sis. 
Have you ever wondered about eternity? There is no beginning or end to it. Nor is there a value of time. You see, the world we live in has very much made all attempts to materialize our lives and portray hell, demons, and utmost, God and heaven as imaginary non existant places. Now i dont know you but you have no idea how glad i am you didnt die. We humans tend to rebel and voice our concern against God when smtng goes wrong and go to our sex, drugs, alcohol, movies or such to celebrate our happiness. So i think you shud thank God you didnt die. 
Go to youtube, search for people who went to hell and back. You might think its a con but and some of them cud be but im telling you most of them aren't. Hell is where this agonizing place of rotting fire and torture? Why wud you choose it? Do you know Jesus spoke more about hell than heaven?? And he said whomever it is with sorrow and heavey burden i shall give rest too. Please thank God you didnt die. Ur lucky.

This is not a vent. I just want to reel you all away from your problems for a second and talk about a big problem that has been overtaking our country for a while. 

Colourism and bullying. 

No. I am not talking about racism but colourism. For those of you who don't know what that means, it's discrimination in which people are treated differently based on the social meanings attached to skin color. And somehow, I don't know when it happened. But this problem has found it's way into our community.

 People of darker skin tone ""tseym"" are as the times go on constantly being told ways to get lighter, called ""barya"", and made fun of because of their dark skin. Don't get me wrong, all people are beautiful. But darker skinned people are constantly told that they are not pretty enough because of their colour and lighter skinned people are told that they are the epitome of beauty. 

This is a mind set not a reality. No, I'm not denying that ""tseym"" people don't have their share of admirers,I'm just looking at the average Ethiopian's thought on things. I see kids being told they're not as pretty or handsome as their siblings or their friends because they are too dark. But why is it this way? Why must we scar children's brains with this thought. Why must we push younger girls to search for lightening products instead of having her work on her personality. Why must we be so vain? 

We are Africans. Our hair is kinky, our lips are big, our noses are stubby, and our skin is burnt. Why should we search for a western image? Why is the western image the representation of beauty? We are all beautiful in our own way. The shade of our skins should not be used to define beauty. Please be considerate. 

Also like I said this is not me saying ""key"" people aren't pretty and tseym people are better. They're not. We're all equal. I just feel like darker skinned people aren't told they're beautiful enough.

 I know I'm gonna get alotta hate on this vent. But I just had to say that. Thank you.

Hey ya’ll don’t know if any of u have ever been thru this but imma go ahead and say it anyway. I’ve been with this girl for a couple of months now and I really fucking love her I mean like in a way that can’t be measured and Ik she loves me that way 2. The problem is i think we love each other so damn much we’re toxic to one another we can’t be near each other without hurting one another. When she wants me 2 do something and I don’t she swears she’ll harm herself and she actually does it sometimes even if I do what she asks of me. I feel like I’m the problem and she wouldn’t  be doing any of this stuff if I weren’t with here. I’m kinda going cray cray just thinking about what she might to next to hurt herself. I rly don’t know what 2 do. This was my last resort and had 2 ask for ur help so what do u think.

I really need to vent cause this has been bugging me for the past few months. You see I have this best friend who I've been friends with for a while now. This person is like a sister to me and we are almost alike mentally. We were roughly around the same neighbourhood and practically lived together. But recently, I moved out of my home and into a neighbourhood farther away from her and we haven't been seeing each other enough. The only time I get to see her is in school but even then it's not enough. Then she started not coming to school one or two times a week. Sometimes even three. She said she had problems of her own and I got that but it still hurt that I didn't get to see her as much. 
With all the shit going on now, I feel like I'm losing her. We aren't as close as we used to be and it hurts so goddamn much to know I can't do anything about it. 
The worst part is that I have these thoughts in my head that I can't stop. I always feel like she's better than me. And that she more loveable and social and even if she ends up being okay if we ended up not being friends anymore , I'd be the one who went to shit. I'd be the one who stays alone. I'd be the one looking stupid cause she's so good at dealing with people that she will have people who have her back and defend her if shit goes bad. I'd be the one hated if we ever broke apart. 
I feel like if this goes bad , I'd lose myself completely. I mean, for a whole year , the only reason I woke up and went to school was cause I didn't want her to be alone. That was my only reason. And if I lose her , I don't think I could ever come back from that. 
I guess that's it. Thank you. If anyone has any advice for me please share.",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9969925880432129

Hey, its my 1st time to vent n idk wr i sld begin from. I hv a kind of change phobia n evry person i told to thought its nt dat big of deal n its Westerns thing ... But it is hard fr me even to change my pen, cloth...
 There was a guy n we used to be best friends but through time i stared hving feelings fr him but he had drt religilon n he hated rns .. so i hid evrything. But one day he moved away n was gone out of my life. This was 1st big change i had to face n we wr vry close i had no life with out him so i departed frm evrything my friends, family, happiness... I thought one day i wld find him n have all z things back... 
And it went like dat fr 6 years cldnt stop crying i become so lonely n even forgot wat happiness was like. Then problems began piling up on me my dad lose job, we started hving financial problems we cldnt afford things we used to do even for our house, school... I cldnt take it anymore i faded away, evry thing hurted..
One day i found my friend again n we began talking... he told me he loved me.. So we started a relation i got hope n i remembered hw happiness felt.. But things wrnt easy as i thought he wldnt trust me, always telling me he wanned to forget me... but i loved him so much i always tried to understand him.. We wanned to meet in person but i didn't hv z money.. But he wldnt understand,he said am hurting him... One day i got money so i went to him n saw him after 6 yrs we talked,walked... We wr happy ... 
After a week he told me dat he was tking about our relation n decided dat he sld forget me, he doesnt want me to spoil his life... i asked if sth happened but he said ntg did. I tried to tell him all i want is to make him happy n am alone i rlly needed him but idk why he just kept ignoring me,... i begged him to give me atleast  chance to see him again once but he threatened to block me n said dat i am bad person i gave him a scar n dat i will always hurt him. 
I swear he was z one thing i hv i gave him space n evrything he asked me but he didnt care he kept hurting me pushing me away, n taking away my hope n evrything.

For any person with suicidal thoughts I've got something to say.

Hey guys I'm NX,I've joined this channel like a year ago because I've been deal'n with the same kinda shit my whole life and all this time I'm reading this texts that r different but at the same time we're all facing the same problems in our lives it got me think'n why is it that our generation is so fucked up it feels like our environment,families,friends and the whole fuck'n world just couldn't give us a break because they start with by making us believe we're worthless;not capable of becoming the best of ourselves without giving us a chance to prove  what we're really capable off because everyone tries to feel good about themselves by keeping us down. I think in one side our country(3rd world country) ppl around us give us all this nonsense because everyone in this fuck'n country are insecure about themselves that they're telling us what to do,how to live without letting us to experience anything in person I mean this ppl r fuck'n losers and stupid that's why we're not developed as a country because no one wants to put in to work everybody tries to find shortcut this society doesn't believe in us because they don't believe on them selves all the system and our families  they r not letting us to become ourselves what I mean by that we should really go out of our comfort zone and strive to our dreams and experience life if you wan do smt just do it without over thinking have a friend meet new ppl pain makes us evolve knowledge is the key to everything I don't mean like seating in the class room or anything just go out research on your own ask ppl try to understand without fear being judged do what really makes you happy we've only lived a decade or two we all have smt special that we deserve to show to ourselves that's when we're all got to show all those peoples that have been doubting us 
On the other hand we all have our own side of story why we're depressed and loosing hope but I think we should all start by stopping the stories that we tell ourselves we should really notice what we're really doing to our brain I guess others r trying to influence our way of thinking by programming our minds by different kinds of methods I don't mean all but some kinds of music just choose wisely what you're doing to your mind

So here's the thing. My dad died when i was 4 and i dont remember him much or miss him a lot but recently i've started to noticed a pattern on how i see guys. I think i keep looking for a father figure in them. And no this isn't some weird sexual fantasy nor am i attracted to creepy old men. It's more on the way of how one makes me feel. I want him to be possesive and controlling, protective and firm but also gentle and kind at the same time kinda like a father in a way??

Hi all. Am new to this.. i need to vent but this is not something i can do with my friends but the thoughts will kill me.. am a weak guy, am so ashamed of my character. people say am handsome i also think am handsome physically but am ugly on the inside  reason being: am so weak. God has blessed me with two great girls i can call lovers over my lifetime... The first we broke up  after she discovered i had sex  with her friend. The second we are now in a huge fight i don't think we will ever get back together... She caught me red handed also with her friend doing sex: They fought so bad that day they had to be separated by hotel guards otherwise they would have killed each other but i wish they could have vented their anger on me instead because am the stupid one i caused that fight... Am very weak, every time a girl lays her hand on me or looks at me in a certain way i feel attracted to her. I don't know how to say no... The reason i slept with her friends is because they got close to me through her and when we are left alone it's a long story but i can't tell, something happens that i can't understand  and then we have sex not that i love them. I feel so worthless there's nothing that can cheer me up right now because am a dumb guy who has no control... i can't write more that's it

Most people hate it when Jesus is the topic of conversation or the minute the bible is mentioned. 
Life is hard. Even in the mist of happiness and joy there is an incoming grief and loss in our life. The richest person will lose some one, may get sick, lose some property, was/is depressed... Same goes for the poorest. If your reading this you ought to know that some day you will encounter happiness and on another day pain. You may think your so comfortable in what you have right now but it WILL perish and change. If you jump in the middle of an ocean and you drown the ocean will spit you out eventually. Your problems are not permanent unless you make them be. 
I have a massage for those who are in some very deep problems just like i am you can find rest in Jesus.
If you were the only person in this world Jesus would still some how come to die for you so you dont need to suffer for long and you would probably be the one to kill him. 
He got wipped, scorched, beaten, laughed at, ridiculed for you... He cried for you... He was in torment for you... He was in fear for you... He became a curse for you. He is saying
Are you in shame? Give me your shame!
Have you been cheated on? Are heart broken? I will heal that!
Do you feel this loop of drugs are killing you inside? I have the life you want! 
Are you in depression? Give me your depression!
Are you tired of living? I will be your strength because i love you with an everlasting love.
Do you feel unclean? Dont! My blood can wash away any dirt.

Can you see your brain with your eyes? No. You just believe you have one. 
God is out there! looking at you with an enormous eagerness to choose him and all the bandage for your problems are in the hands of jesus. 
Jesus is enough!

Hey, so i been dating this guy for almost a year now but it was mostly a distance relationship. We started having stupid arguments in due time and i was the one never satisfied. The kind of affection and attention i got from him never felt enough that i kept asking myself am i really looking for fake shit because i know that he loved me and i was just not okay with the fact that the more time that passed the more he was colder and i think that was his way of getting comfortable with me i really don't know. Becha we were having too much arguments and the first breaking up idea was initiated by me and that got him really mad bc he was right, we can't keep trying while one of us were fed up and wanted to be separated i got that but i never really meant it every time i asked for a break up so i end up texting him I'm sorry and we would get back together.
But this time around when i apologized and asked for another chance he specifically told me he cant do this anymore and that he ""lost some feelings for me, nothing will change so it's not worth trying, would rather be happy alone and that he is in peace with him self and also would rather focus on whats good for him and his family with me out of the picture""
Im struggling a lot my self with my mother being really sick and i can't be there with her is totally worrying me and depressing me asf, and also losing my best friend who meant the world kinda fucked me up too so i tried my best to explain to him that i made a wrong decision when i asked for a break up and that i love him and am still in love with him, i really wished he believed me when i told him i never loved anyone the way i love him.
Do you think he would contact me or miss me? it's been 5 days since we last talked so does he need more time to miss me? I think i can feel myself being obsessive
if you are reading this love you"" A"" i really do and im so sorry i keep fucking up i can move on but i don't want to move on.
I can make you happy and treat you better if you give me a shot. Sorry i cant contact you its just not right.

Hi y'all. I feel like I have to get this off my chest. 
It's been a while over now. It's been 6 years struggling with depression and anxiety, and I made nothing out of my 20 years. It's been a while since I felt alive. It took me of everything I ever had. Crippled with self doubt and self loathing. I can't remember a time where it wasn't so difficult to have a good day without my mind telling me of everything I've failed to do, everything I could have been and everything that I'm not. I hate myself for being so low. As if I asked for it. As if it was my own creation and I have to atone for it. I can't remember the last time I did something and felt good about it. I distanced myself from everyone, shut out the rest of the world and now I'm drowning in addiction I was so afraid of. All that and I still haven't paid enough for it. It still devours me of my everything, as if I had more things to lose. Church didn't help. Friends didn't help. Pills didn't help. Bad omens and nothing more. I long for the things I willingly lost. I wish I could have friends and a better peace of mind. But that always ends up somewhere around south. Somewhere around Rock bottom and even lower self esteem.
And I contemplate ever so eagerly, really, is there a way out of this? And am I gonna get any better? Isn't 20 years plenty if not enough?",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9876584410667419

Does we really need love?? I mean like do we realllllly need it can we consider it as one of the basic thing for human beings...
Or we can just live and leave in this world without ever feeling it .

People lie. They bend the truth and hide things. And I'm completely okay with it  BC I get them i  understand .....but the one thing I can't deal with is that   They use you for temporary happiness and drop you when something better comes along. They play you. Even those who you don’t expect!

I used to think friendship was the most important thing on earth but I’m slowly learning. People are selfish. Now I am being selfish. I don’t want to have friends anymore. I don’t want to put all my love and time ,money ,energy, affection into a person who takes advantage of it. I don’t want to give my attention to all the people who leave me high and dry. I don’t want to support and advise those who can’t do it in return.

I’m tired. I’m exhausted. I’m sick. People make me ill and I need to get better. I need this cycle to stop. I need to be alone for me. I have been selfless and caring for far too long. 
There are might be true friends  out  there but I'm too exhausted . I’m taking my heart back and there’s only enough room for it nd that's  to love me.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9941341280937195

Hi there 12,668 people with ur own problems and ur miserable or perfect lives, before u start - this may be a complete waste of your time- anyways here is my bitter confession...not really a confession but never told anyone so kinda a secret. I am an 18 years 1 month and 12 days old male person, i haven't done any of the things that an 18 year old should have done by now, like having a girlfriend, having sex, even kissing a girl or any other activities my fellow generation would call a ""score!"". I'm not shy, but i don't get why people talk just for the sake of talking...i won't describe myslef as an extrovert but i can be so milasam and outgoing when i want to, but i choose to plug in my earphones and ignore the world for most of the time. My friends would describe me as a funny guy but when i'm with a new person i may come out a bit retard-ish. This confession is not about me and girls it's just a part of it. Now i do know that i'm gonna be a complete success one day (atleast i hope, and i'm trying) but things aren't looking good for me at the moment. I'm just a skinny, broke, freshman at some college. But my real issue nowadays is My look. I couldn't  care less about my looks a year back, but now everything seems to depend on it. Not just girls but dudes too. (Not gay)Let me explain. I have come to know lately, that looks are very important, first impressions go a long way and a pretty face can be just the bitch to do that. It's just I'm not sure about my look, my mom says i'm konjo all the time but i think that's her job....now i'm not blind so i know I'm not George cloony, but i don't think i'm below average..or maybe i am, i don't know....but i hate myself for even comparing myself with others......this confession won't ever end if i start about my actual life which i will postpone for some other time , so i just wanna ask u guys one quick question (you gotta be honest) .... i know it matters for guys too but i don't know how to make a question out of it so I'm just gonna make the question for girls and see if i can make some conclusions based on ur answers... .would u rather date a

So I got this mood swing problem just that it’s really not a fun mood swing one second I’m very cheerful and the next I’m angry, and not just angry I genuinely think I wanna make people upset with my words not even so that I can win an argument or something I genuinely feel like I have to disappoint those I love and I lost someone really important to me over this but I figured that I’d have to live with this as it’s mine to bear I’m just hoping I don’t do it again because I really don’t know I see red out of the blue and all I see is upsetting people and winning an argument that isn’t even there and then when I’m back to my senses I feel bad.

Everything just hurts.  For years, I've struggled with Depression and for awhile I thought things were getting better.  I got a job, I'm able to help with bills and help others.  Slowly though, I feel it creeping up again and weighing me down.  I know I am here, that things and people exist but everything seems far away?  Like I'm just staring at everything through the glass of a fishbowl and I don't know where my feelings are. Not enough to be honest with anyone.  People say I'm fake, ""Oh, I don't know how you can do it.  Being fake all the time.""  I'm not being fake, I just don't want to show you anything because I know you won't understand.  You'll roll your eyes and turn away, that's fine.  No one is obligated to feel otherwise, but it hurts like hell when you open yourself and only get mocked/ laughed for it.

 If my pillow had mouth, it could have expressed how I feel more than my own self. Am dying inside specially when u always keep it to your self it kills the most who cares tho even I tried to suicide so no one is expected to care. Mom said "" gurmesena nw"" dad don't even know what happened. They divorced when I was 5. My dad is a real jerk. He slept with my moms sister(aunt) even with lots of servants in the house. And my mom always blame me for that because the reason she married that man is me, she was pregnant. Eski tell me anything I should have done to stop her eski tell me one good reason to be blamed. She always say"" esua yabatua lij nat chekagn aremene"" but am nothing like that I swear she don't care about how I feel when she tells everyone that she he's a rapist and real bitch. She told every of my friends that he always do sex chats, even worse. Unless you've been through it, you won't know how that hurts.

Got a bit of a complicated problem here I've been smoking weed on and off for a couple of years now personally I've never had that big of a problem with. I didn't used to smoke that often maybe a couple of times a month and some times there would be months in bn when i wouldn't. But now things have changed i smoke almost every other day. I just have so much free time and it's a good way to chill and hangout with girls. Till now it hasn't affected my life in a negative way i still think weed is awesome and everyone should let loose once in a while espacialy if you're college and you just want to get away from the stresses of school and life in general, not in a bad way but just as a release and just have a few laughs but i don't want to be a pot head either.

This is  for that person who feels stuck in life and feels hopeless. That person who doesn’t know if life will get better. That person who’s been trying to make a change for so long, but hasn’t been able to. I know things have been tough lately. Every day feels the same and you want to scream from the top of your lungs because it sucks. Every day you feel like you’re on a downward spiral. You just hope that your life starts to change real soon. Thoughts of suicide have crossed your mind because then you wouldn’t feel like this anymore, but just know there is much more to life than you have now. It does get better if you want it to.I was once you. I searched for what was the one thing I was supposed to do with my life. I felt like if I knew what I wanted to do with my life everything would be better. Everything else would fall into place. I’d get married, have a nice house, have kids, and live happily ever after.To me life is about exploring everything out there. It’s trying different things and putting more attention on certain ones. There’s so much out there that it’d be a shame to not have more than one interest. Is what I’m doing now what I’ll be doing forever? No, but I’ve found something that I enjoy at this moment. I know new opportunities will present itself and my need for a new challenge will come along. Who knows what I’ll be doing five years from now, but for now, I like what I do and have stopped searching for the meaning of life.If you don’t know what you want to do with your life, it’s okay! The answer doesn’t come to you at a specific time. Some find it when they’re a child. Others discover it after they’ve had three children. It doesn’t matter if you’re 21, 41 or anywhere in between. It’s never too late to start doing what you wnat. Just a tip  better life isn’t going to be found watching television, keeping up with Honey Boo-Boo or the Kardashians, mindlessly surfing the internet, or checking Facebook every five minutes. It’s not found sitting on the couch after work every night or drinking your sorrows away every weekend with your buddies. Your life won’t improve if you constantly feel sorry for yourself or rely on others to make it better for you.So what will it take? I know you don’t want to hear it, but it’s going to take one day at a time. You need to start making deliberate choices and stop sleepwalking through life. What’s even worse is you will be doing things you should be doing on a consistent basis and you’re not going to see any results or feel any different. I know that’s frustrating.

I've had something on ma mind since keremt started and tho its nat a big deal I just wanted to listen wat u guys have to say(specially girls)
Well I just finish 12th grade and I'm getting ready for campus and then I realized that I haven't done anything that a teenager would do in there high school life. Like I never kissed a girl or never even had a girl friend and stuff like that. And I never gave a shit about that until last week me and my friends were talking about the life we had in high school(u know the old times) and all mentioned there first r/ship but me. and that's when it hit me. Well its not that I'm not good lookin, I mean I'm average. I'm also not the kind of guy that's afraid to talk to girls(tinish tinish binorebegnem) gn its not that bad. but the worst thing is that everytime I get closer to a girl, well next thing I know I'm not in the friend zone.........kezam alfo I'm in the brother zone. U know like someone to talk to while having trouble with her boy friend and stuff.
But now I'm sick of being amakari. I mean its not bad people trusting u and being a solution for there prob. gn I want a girl of my own to. U know ur soulmate. the person you'll be with for better or for worse, gf and my best friend at the sametime.

In my opinion gay people syamrachew lemen feres aybedum who am I to care. This shouldn't be illegal like the govt doesnt have to interfere with what you do with ur own dick. But i support the idea of telling them that their assholes are being destroyed and advise them to stop, if they say no then let them go at it and get every std. Do u think they were like ""hey lets become gay""? No. They just became gay they didnt ask for it. I dont know anyone who wants to be beaten oppressed and jailed and thats how I know that they didnt ask for it. Note : Im still not gay i just felt sorry for them.",approval,NEGATIVE,0.9910615086555481

Well its been like a month now since ive seen him.. i completley shut him out this time cuz i was almost sure he would be gone forever. Hes a high school graduate now and i still am in high school 2 years until i graduate
its not the typical high school relationship u think its like we both know we like eachother but we act like we hate eachother ...wierd right?
Ego is what i thought it was.. but i dont know i think its fear
Fear of me missing him when he goes to collage and lives his life without me.. there is no way this can work out right? I still have a little ray of hope
I have never stopped missing him. Everyday every night. He is always in my thoughts. always.

And my boyfriend was transferred to somewhere far from me i allowed him(tbh nooo! I want/need him) to have sex partner over there. On a condition that he would be open about that with me and Tell me everything. As long as he doesnt choose her over me i want him to enjoy everything he can while he can.i don't want to stress him over everything and control him. And if he loses me for a sex gal.thats his lose.

I don't know if anyone can relate but I feel like nothing works out for me. My life is a constant mess, I face new obstacles on top of old once, my family ain't much help either. My parents are divorced, my mother is mentally unstable and doesn't get along with anyone, my dad started a new life and has two kids. I'm a university student at the worst campus. And on top of that I have financial issues, my mom is jobless and my dad sends me lil cash, my uncle's and aunt's give me cash once in awhile but I feel so dependent.

I still dont want to admit that my feelings have grown towards her. But I dont know for how long this can continues. I sometimes want just to blurt it out n actually say 'I love you'. And again I'll be afraid that is not how i actually feel about her. That's why i never talked abt this to any of my or our friends. Plus I don't think I'm good enough for her.

You know what? It is so amusing when I see a lot of guy homophobes. Most of them do not hate homosexuality because its against religion or disgusting or it might affect their relatives or whatever. The real reason is because they don't want to be treated the way they treat women. They don't want a guy checking out their ass, or objectifying them like they do to girls. They don't want the increasing possibility that they can get raped just like girls. I've heard this line from 'prison break'. The guy said, ""They raped me like a little bitch."" I say, he got what he deserved. I want an era where men understand how a woman feels when she's walking across a bunch of guys. I know all the guys here are going to lose their minds and call me bitch or whatever insult they can come up with but I'm just fine because I just got this off my chest.

Lets get straght in to it i'm a dude & I'm going to comment on feminism.
Reason for why bother !
I think it is on the air and most girls in Ethiopia are now identifying with it. i know it is their choice bt i think i saw a major flaw in it which actually i could help ppl.
after watching the movies , listening to the music and  politics which all started teaching it in mass scale now a days. i felt maybe i'm like those guys ena i should be obligated to understand it so i started reading books and listening to lectures on this topics of female gaze & female study, i also studied abt patriarchy.

Here are what i got, the world is shity and depressing through that lense .....plus it was not convincing because the way i see it men could not have those free time to inslave womens for thousands of years or create this massive system(patriarchy) just to inslave ""the other sex""

In general I feel like this 3rd wave feminism give girl excuse for not participating on society like to lazy around and blame the standard of society 

Demo i hate it when they belittle there nature i.e being the nurturer. it is not by any means the inferior thing in this dain age. think abt it, every bodys hero is his mom. it needs dedication and sacrifice to be good at it and no body can do it like that! ....and yes no man or no culture thinks being  just a mother as shity job for a person because every body understands its vitality

Yehen sel demo i am not saying u cannot work or follow ur other dream, u can do both which mens actually doesn't have a privilege ( a mom and success on society meaning a plus to u)
Endewem andande sasebew maybe it steams from ur frustrations when u think now a days u r expected to be both successful on work and being mom within a short period of time .....my answer to this is fuck expectations,  do u and do whatever u think it is right for u

Ena embrace this nature demo; because softness and fragility is not weakness, it is just beauty
 
 i am not saying there is no discrimination because there is BUT not on the cities of Ethiopia and specially in west. 
 Any sane human is up for equal opportunity 
So stop blaming history ,  religion, society for personal inadequacies 
If u have any additional perspective i missed, i am up for re-education",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.997800886631012

I'm 22Y0, It seems I'm stuck in my childhood. I've had bad memories as a child so I usually practiced forgetting things that caused me pain. I literally mastered it to such an extent whenever I'm in pain, I use the same mechanism of forgetting, the problem is forgetting the source of pain does relieve me for sometime but the pain never goes away it stays there without a name. It's hard for me to bear a pain I don't the know the cause of.
That being said, this forgetfulness has somewhat affected my normal life as well. I seem to remain unattentive, unfocus as if always in search of something.
The question why I feel like I'm stick in my childhood! Well, I feel like I'm very bad at decision making, it's very hard for me to comprehend emotions. I feel like I'll never be understood, my self esteem has hit the rock bottom, I never ever had self confidence, I never ever have felt like fighting for myself. I'm very forgiving, I forgive people easily though I remain cautious. But my act of kindness is always perceived as being a weakling. I'm told that I'm an idiot, maybe I'm, the kind who doesn't know where she was wrong. I'm always scolded or corrected for being me. I've literally forgotten who I am and how I was! I'm not that much religious but I've faith in God. I don't know why but due to my exhausted mental state, my connection with God is also suffering.

It's hard to explain but Let me make this clear. I am White Hat Hacker (the good guys) I haven't hacked anyone without the proper permission.

I hacked my girlfriend. I have her full permission(even video prove) She knows everything about me and how geeky I am. but as you might know, you can't fully erase a data. 
It all began 2 years ago. We met, we fall in love ... the usual stuff. But in the summertime we can't see each other. Before she left for the last summer she Herself gave me access to her social media accounts to prove herself. I trusted her 100% and I didn't need her accounts but ok. Everything was fine. At the end of last summer she started acting weird I noticed and asked her if everything was cool. She said yeah ... you can check my account if you want ... so I loged into her accounts and as I suspected there was flirting and late night calls. she deleted them but data is recoverable. I asked her again if she wants to tell me something. She refused and acted normal. I told her everything I saw. She kept lying. I gave up and told her I wanted to break up she immediately cried and told me everything, even things I didn't know. I love her and I couldn't leave her. But in one condition she would never lie to me. We agreed. Then the summer passed.

She started living with me. Everything was cool. When you know someone for a long time you can understand their thoughts. 
She left for this summer. After a month later I noticed suspicious behaviors. I asked and checked her accounts everything was normal. I still had the same feeling. I did some research took me a while but I found out she had new everything (phone number, social media accounts,...) that's not normal. I asked her about the number she told me it was her aunt's but I knew. I was mad so we broke up for 6 days. I love her, I thought it was my mistake and tried to get back together. She refused and treated me like a dog. I accepted it thinking I was wrong. Then she told me not to hack her anymore. I respected her request and got back together. Within those 6 days her father asked her if she wanted to marry foreign person she agreed this happened on the 2nd day. I was mad as ahhhhhh but I let it slip. Today I called her 09:02 PM (21:02) and she was talking on the phone. She immediately called and told me it was her cousin I didn't even ask. I said ok just send me a screenshot of you phone log. She showed some aggressive behavior and agreed and sent it. She had deleted the number and called her cousin to replace it. Anyone can tell that it was modified even the time tells the truth. I asked her if she wanted to tell me something. She said there was nothing and acted aggressive. I hanged up the phone. She called twice and I answered on the 3rd call. She confessed she was talking to someone who found her number somewhere and called to chat with her and that's the only thing she lied about. Usually when I get mad I say some bad stuff. But this time I kept quiet. She started crying and begging. I can't bare to see someone like that. I calmed her down accepted her apologies. 5 min later I said I only need the truth. She started cried again I calmed her again and told her we'll talk about it tomorrow. 

I think My suspicions were true. She very much lied. And there is more going on with that person she talked to. 

Any suggestions would be helpful.",love,NEGATIVE,0.5515698790550232

Hey. Today, I have sth to tell. I mean yeah i obviously have sth but let me make it clear. I have never told any soul before about this.
For the world, I am a normal teenager girl who has her own insecurities and normal issues. Like she feels not enough, ugly...stuff. But no one will ever think that I am lonely. I guess thats because I am never alone. But not a single person seems to identify z difference between alone and lonely. 
I feel empty. I feel fake. I mean I don't even know the real me. Every person that knows me, knows different mes. I don even want to be like that but I just can't.
I have trust issues. Like very giant ones. I don even trust myself, not my shadow. I have a phobia of trusting people. I never had a bf before and I think I will never have. I mean how can u not trust ur partner, ur soulmate? 
My family has this image about me. They think its a clear one but no. Its not even close. Its just an impersonation. As I said, no one knows me. Not even myself. I never felt z real self of me.
People say I am intelligent and bright girl but no one knows I am living a false fiction in which I am having z longest journey.

Getting straight into it, I've never rly had any problem getting girls in the past. I believe that i have a certain confidence that most ppl don't have and it comes of in the way i carry myself. But lately I've been striking out a lot...not just striking out but other guys have been swooping in and for a lack of a better word ,taking the girls, right up from under me. I've ruled out all the obvious causes like they're better looking than me or they have better game but that's not the case. It's just the shear amount of lies they tell this girls, it's just lie up on lie upon lie and the girls eat it up. I've always thought eye contact and good conversation made for a great connection but lately it seems like abseen lies and empty promises is the way to go instead.Not only that but this guys are so clingy and possessive to the point the girl has so choice but to go home with them at the end of the night .

Well I don’t have solid subject to vent about it

Wouldn’t things been much easier 
If we were straight forward 

Like if you wanna fuck someone you just tell them and if they felt the same about you 

You guys take into the bed and finish the rest of the convo there? 


Wouldn’t relationship be much easier and less painful if guys and girls stop lying in order to get specific thing outta of a person 
Dick,pussy,money,status,or whatever he/she possesses? 

Wouldn’t job interview be easier 
Telling them ur lazy and sleep on desk to avoid getting fired later and feel depressed and they avoid hiring the wrong dumbfuck? 

Seriously if we were honest the world would’ve been better.

Standards,protocols,society, ruin 
our objectives and intentions our purpose we had in the beginning of things cause no one will accept it cause it differs from theirs which push people to lie just to get what they want it’s a torture that we can’t be honest and we have to lie to get things on the move

Look i Never wanted to do this, but fuck it and hear my story
Its was a while back  family was going through divorce every thing was falling apart , i fell into depression for a long time. I had no friends, everything was going downward spiral.  Then afrer like 2 years of missery i met this girl,  we became friends, my first friend in a veryyy while, since i was isolated 

And then she kinda liked me i guess, things changed and she became my girlfriend.  After being together for 3 months she told me she has HIV in her,...  long story short i decided to be with her no matter what,  i decided to Marry her and be with her,  but after a year went by she started acting weird and one day she told me she doesn't want me anymore because some guy from her past was back in life and she left me for him, 

A bit letter she came back crying and everything and begged me to take her back,  i said no but after some time i was missing her too much plus i thought to my self everybody learns from their mistake hoping this will be ""it""

After like 8 months she told me she told me she doesn't want me anymore and left me again 

Its been 3 years since then,  she tried to get in touch here and there but now she is trying her hardest and im not even saying anything to her but there is this fake account of hers which she doesn't know i know, she talks to me there and she been telling me how she regrets her past minamn.

Here is my life , atleast a glimpse of it.
Am  a 24 years old man
I dont know if I am depressed or I am crazy anxious. Everyday waking up I've this nonsense  conversations with myself about being unsuccessful in every aspect of my life.
I just graduated from a field I have no interest in. All my life I've lived to be a door mat,pleasing people and trying to make people like me by exactly not being myself 

I am unable to socialize with people because I've lost almost all my social skills all of a sudden.

Seeing people being themselves and enjoying life makes me realize that am not even close to living  life.
just thinking about my future and mistakes I did in my past make me very anxious.
I catch people staring at me, turns out it's a sign of social anxiety (atleast that's what the internet says) 
I dont pray like I used to .
I cant even Express what I want verbally because there is this mind fog that distracts me every darn time.
All this feelings and thoughts and things   happen to me everyday. Am irritated easily ..I try making myself better but there always this resistance in me.. 
What ever I do, there is something in me that critics me  , 
I am always good at giving advice to people but when it comes to myself I cant do  anything .
I've come to realize that I have nothing in me that I like. 
Am I going to be like this forever?

He knows u have feelings for him but acts oblivious. He knows u want more than just being his friend or the girl he messes with when he is bored. He knows u get hurt every time he says shit. He knows u well enough to know u are hurting inside. But he doesn't care, does he?  He knows u deserve better than that but wouldn't let u move on and he is never gonna give u what u really deserve . even if he knows it deep down that u love him he wont even go as far as taking u out on a proper date.

At some points in my life I overwhelm myself in to deep depression and anxiety. This thought that I have to be perfect. Have to be successful. It doesn't revolve around me being happy. At some point I just stopped trying so hard to keep it all balanced. Being happy and putting myself down till having panic attacks . I feel my panic attacks when I feel like this is the only choice and I'm fucking it up  ...
So exams ...they stress me out so much that at some point I go in blanckk. The anxiety exams put me through leads me to a darker part of my depression. The part that constantly tells me that I should be productive and not sit at home all day. That constantly tells me I ain't never gonna be good enough. That I have no control. That my future is unseen. That tells me that I have no safety net to catch me if I fall out of control. It goes to physically hurting me my heartbreaks. I'm a sensitive person do that happens on a daily basis. I do think of suicide sometimes ...not seriously..but I put this unrealistic idea n let in float ...my only plan for suicide is to jump off the tallest building on Earth.

Hey unihorse 
I just have to explain to people what depression actually is because the level of ignorance is stunning. So first of all we as human beings have a feedback control system in our brains. When good shit happens to us we feel good. When bad shit happens we feel bad. Like when a person breaks up or rejects you. You are supposed to feel negative emotions. Or when we are constantly alone we feel negative emotions because by default we are social animals and you are feeling this emotions so that you have the motivation to do something about your loneliness. 
But clinically depressed people what ever the situation maybe only feel negative emotions. Their feedback control system in their brain is not working correctly.  Whatever situation they are in they feel negative emotions. Hence the brain scans and medications are given to such people.
But for most people in this group (even though sharing is good) aren't really depressed. Because they drone about why they are depressed. BUT THE WHOLE POINT IS A DEPRESSED PERSON DOESNT KNOW WHY HE/SHE IS DEPRESSED. They just feel negative emotions continuously.
 I am sure your problems and emotions are real but that doesn't mean you are  depressed. 
And I know depression is a popular word nowadays to mean sad and I am not trying to be the depression police saying ""don't use it"". But just be aware it is a SERIOUS FUCKING DISEASE.AND NOT YOUR EMOTION OF THE DAY",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9981800317764282

I have been reading some of the stories you guys shared and i saw similarities in most of your problems. Not judging you, i have problems too gen just wanted to help.

 I mean most of you are keeping up with someone who cheated, lied, abused and used you. Im not saying seek revenge, but is this what you want to live with the rest of your life. I mean don't you want to be loved, cared for, protected(mentally, emotionally, and physically). Specially the girls you are keeping up with cheaters, those who will throw you after getting what they want, those who will and are abusing you. I mean is he the one you want to have kids and raise with. I mean is he the one: who will protect(emotionally,  mentally, physically) your kids or is he the one, who will insult you, cheat and beat you infront of them. Does he have the personality and quality that your future daughter will wish to marry or avoid. ask your self before entangling your self with this person. Im not saying think about marriage, but you say you are in love and you ""want to be with him forever"" as most of you feel. So why not choose wisely and cautiously. I mean you feel like you want to give him your entire life so why not be selective of your choice.

Lastly if you talk to marriage counsellors they will agree with me on this point. Most of the divorced couple were in love at some point, but being in love didn't save their marriage. What im trying to say is dont try to give your entire life to someone just because you feel so. Because your life has much more value than you think. If your relationship fails the lifes of people that surround you will also be affected: like your parents, siblings, kids if you have any and your future kids too. So be careful with whom you entangle yourself with. Your best examples will be those who are victims of domestic violence and acid attacks,....
 
I have last bit of an advice if you agree with it take it if not reconsider it. I dont agree with sex before marriage. Before starting to insult and curse me hear me out. When you are with someone who you like or not to spend time with, you are making a memory it can be a happy one or not. Most cases of sexual dissatisfaction is because of past experiences. Most of the couples who have been with numerous sexual partners have reported not being pleased(having an orgasm) by their current sexual partner. I mean why will you risk your future and lasting relationship to sexual dissatisfaction. I leave the judgement to you. 

Here are some of the books i will recommend you to read.
- The sacred search by Gary L Thomas 
- the purpose and power of women 
- the purpose and power of men 
- waiting and dating 
All three are written by Dr myles munroe

So I wanted to say this with as few words as humanly possible but I know it won’t be short so here goes it’s for all the believers out here for a second don’t dense up your ears and allow me to ask you things that matter do you genuinely believe that there is a God...we’ll ofc you do but why...do you suppose an all knowing God would put us up on the earth knowing our endings fire or glory, do you think an all knowing god would choose only a group of people to save for thousands of years only to save leave the rest to flames...do you think not believing in him to praise his glory for millennias to come yet still doing good things in life regardless ends as a bad story book...well if all his will giving abilities count to him knowing our outcomes does it matter how things go...really think about this for a second like I have and tell me I’m wrong so perhaps is it wrong to just love one another without fear of punishment from God...do we really have to forge an idea of an afterlife so we can be better people can’t we just be...good...if there’s more divide amongst us because of what we believe is religion or belief really even correct can’t we just live as the primitive species and see the bigger picture and love one another...tell me now",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9894205331802368

What is in me now won't take me to where i want. I know it deep down it's just the same old story with minor adjustments. I can pretend all is merry just so i can face tommrow and yet at the end of each day i lay before my truth. This thing this feeling i wouldn't call it sadness or pity just a cocktail of frustration and acceptance. A being running on the most basic of human instincts. Maybe the only purpose of this slimy bag of flesh between my ears is to crap out theamless words and bare witnesses to all its unguided rampage on all that is good. And to never be satisfied with any state always yearning for somthing different. The iterations of my thoughts cover me in layers of illusions. Lies so deeply woven they even fool me into thinking i might be someone else but its when the day claws and shreds this facade i just sit. The sound of fate ringing in my ears and i can see it clearly. I could lay in the mess I've made but I'd still be the dirtiest thing there. It is peaceful when i just am.

P.S: A very long post !!!

Hey there Unihorse people. This is my first vent, and my confession ever. I've never talked about it to anyone. So 6 years ago, when I was in High school, I met this girl. We live under one roof since she has no one but my step mom. We got to chit chat through Facebook, and things started to get serious. We used to just kiss on check and small talks, no horny sexy stuff. I left the country and then came back two years aftet that. So exactly 4 years ago, we still had that feeling, of just talking and a kiss on checks. So she once asked me to come down the stairs, and boom, I had my first kiss EVER. We kissed on lips, and it was a good experience. Then, things got out of hand. Once she asked to a living room, and we started kissing on lips, and she got horny a bit and grabbed my hand onto her tities. I was very afraid, because I'm a very strict person, and I stopped it. That's when she stopped kissing me and said, don't you want us to do it.. I was afraid, and asked her for her forgiveness and continued, and yes, I touched her tits and even ate them. Things escalated and we had the chance when the house was empty. She called me to her room, and bam, this virgin guy is about to fuck a lady. I was nervous. I started fucking her, and then after she cums, she stops me and started crying. (I was still hard). Then she explained to me that she isn't virgin and she had sex with her teacher at high school. I was her man so I tried to calm her down, and I said to her that I'll accept you with your goods and bads. Days went by, and we used to have sex on a daily basis. Like daily basis. She even used to wake me up in the morning before she goes to school and I fuck her then she goes. Like literally daily basis. Morning, when she comes back to school, whenever we find that the house is empty. We even used to make out anywhere, even in public, even in small rooms, even in a restroom. We kept on for like two months, on this way. Then came the day that I had to go back home abroad to finish my high school. It was hard for both of us, because it wasn't guranteed that I'll be back. And we genuinely love each other, not only the sex part. We lovvvved each other. So I went home, and two months later, she sent me a message telling me that she'll break with me caue we are apart and that's hard to handle. And then she deleted the only way I could talk to her, her facebook account, she also changed her phone number. Two years later, I came to Ethiopia, and obviously resided in the house, where obviously she is living too. It was awkwars at the beginning, due to the history between us. But then things got smoother, and now we are friends, as if nothing happened. We talk, we discuss things, we eat together, we live together as we used to. But nothing of that! Sometimes when I get horny, I just reminisce how cloooose we were and how great sex we had. 

Now we are like friends, like real close good friends, is that normal!!!?",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9945324659347534

I know it will probably be awkward and uncomfortable and even painful but I just really wanna get it over with and move on with my life. I'm a high school senior and I'd really like to lose my virginity before University. So anyway there is this guy that I know. He doesn't go to my school and I've only met him a couple times but I know his a player and he'd be down to do it.I don't know him that well but we have a lot of chemistry and I'd rather it be him than any of my exes.

Then grade 7 ended before I said anything.  Keza in grade 8 I was losing my mind over her. I thought about her soooooo much that my grades went down from 10th to 23. But still I didn't say anything to her coz I was afraid.  In grade 9 we got into separate classes and I was very mad. But a day never goes by without me thinking about her. But I still didn't say shit, I couldn't even tell someone. The in grade 10 my BEST FRIEND told me that he loves her. Think about it. Then I had to hide my feelings and I just gave him advice. He told her that he liked her then she rejected him. And finally in grade 12 we got in the same class. But then I found out that she hooked up with my grade 5 BEST FRIEND, I was heartbroken but I just accepted it. They didn't last much though, they broke up at some time. But I didn't say anything to her. Then when we came to campus idk what but something just motivated me to tell her and I did. But she rejected me, TWICE. And now I just can't get over her. I think about her all the time and can't even sleep at all sometimes..... Can you guys have help me out with some advice??",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9876770377159119

What do you think it means by depression? Like everyone talking am depressed by this dude and depressed by my family. Depression is at another level for eg you are depressed because he cheated on you this is some dumb shit.

Just random insights , what's ur opinions on these 
1 why aren't there more rich and successful people in this country? Is it because we are so accustomed to the traditional way of thinking and living life? Why are people not open to new ideas or lifestyles?

2 why do people starve on the streets when they could commit a simple crime ,go to prison where they could  get served food? We all know what people would do to save their lives when they are at the peak of survival.

3 why is feminism such a thing when it's all about empowering women while making men inferior? What's up with all the latest movies where the women are the heroes and the men look wimpy and girlish? Its obvious both genders are different ,one being good at sth than the other on some specific areas but the reason behind feminism is just a total bullshit . Or let's just put a man and a woman in the same fighting ring and see what happens

4 ever wonder why we wear branded clothing like Adidas,  Nike....like we are gonna get paid  promoting their stuff ?

5 imagine being the most richest man on the planet, u have all the money, the cars , the companion of ur friends relatives. And u r so rich that you dont even have to work at all. imagine what your purpose in life  would be then. Because still having all things in life including family and money, still doesn't give comfort to the human mind 

6 why do people blame some girls to be gold diggers ? everyone wants  a that comfortable and lavish way of living life, so what's wrong with wanting that?  Would you rather be poor and miserable and have sick kids ? 

I know we (habeshans) are very judgmental and a new way of thinking is underappreciated. We often go for approval than speaking our minds so feel free to say anything in the comments",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9979857206344604

I'm a 16 year old boy and I have been thinking of things lately. So here is the thing , my parents got divorced when I was abt 6 or 7 but they live together saying that me and my brother need both parents and I appreciated it. Idk y but they argue every night in a disturbing and a stressing way. I love them both but they got problems like every time I'm talkin with my father he turns the conversation into a scary talk like I did sth wrong also he doesn't rlly care abt things he even say unspeakable shit to me, my mom got the same issue with the conversation thing and because of this thing I stop talking to them and other ppl thinking they might do the same. Sometimes I feel like my little bro is the only child in the house plus he is getting meaner but sometimes he is nice. If he get the chance he will try to insult me and make ppl laugh which rlly hurts. Idk y but my mom is on me like all the time (I'm not saying she and my dad are bad ppl) with no reason and every time I'm done with my chores she pick out a mistake and use it against me and it rlly piss me off. I know it may sound like nth but this shit has started since I was 7 and I'm sick of it . I'm kinda happy in school but every time I get into the house I just wish God could take my soul and keep it. Lately I was thinking to get away from home and never return but on second thought I'm like where would I go"" but the pain and all this shit is driving me crazy and I'm getting rlly angry just thinking of.

Grief is in the air tonight. It is suffocating me. But it doesn't make sense, I haven't lost anybody, except maybe myself. I feel like I've been here before but i don't remember how I got through it then. I feel so invisible and trivial. I see my peers going on about their lives as if they'd live forever. They look like they don't carry all the venom they've ever encountered since they knew what it was. They are well adjusted human beings, and I am mentally ill. But I hide, I don't know how well tho. I just hide and feel sorry for myself. I hide and feel angry with myself because I'm here feeling sorry for myself and not trying to fix myself. I hate myself. I wish I could die. Some days I think I'll grow out of this angst, but I've been thinking that for years now and it just keeps getting worse. I don't know if I even have a self that can be saved anymore. I barely remember how to be happy anymore, I don't know how to smile without that ache in my heart. I've forgotten how it feels like to be young (but I'm still young...this is how it is for me, ig).  do you know what I want to do now, I want to go out and buy a blade. I haven't cut in months, but since the past two weeks, I cannot stop thinking about how it would feel like to drag the edge right down the inside  my left arm, going deeper than I've ever went.

Hi unihorse
I need to vent 

So i met this guy a year ago when i was just about to leave campus. we'v never meet in person like.. i know him but we never met we started talking online and Good lord he is extraordinary  i fall for him and i told him that i need to take it to the next step he didn't even trusted me back then cause he was hurt so many times. he is a bit weird and psyco.... not that i don't like his weirdness but idk sometimes i feel like he is way intelligent than who i am and most of the time i feel insecure. And just when i'v had enough of feeling like i piece of trash i told him that we need to stop  (duh he ignored me for like 5 damn days straight) all ma friends said "" u doing good u better off with out him anyways""...and i'm like nah  so he apologized and asked for a second chance and i said ok lets give it a shot from that day forward he made me the happiest of all,  he began to understand me and ma flaws. We were doing way better untill this week..  he said he won't be online for couple of days which is the only way i could talk to him (we don't do phone calls that much) i texted him like thousand times called him he said he is ok and he is changing for the better and he will be back soon (sounded like ""i said i'm ok  women"" kinda voice) he is the kinda guy who dose what he belives in like he goy his own ways of doing stuff i know he cares about me and i'm a so worried about our future (u know he is far from where i live not even planning on comeing here and stuff )  i'm so afraid that i'm gonna lose him.

long story short, here it goes...
i'm a guy 23, i had a girlfriend, we've known each other for 6 years. people's were jealous of our relationship. last December we decided to spend a night together for the first time,... things went as planned... we had a romantic dinner nd we went to our room, we cuddled for a while and that's where the whole story changed, she got hyper-exited and she seized and went to complete unconsciousness. by that moment i was really nervous and worried so i shouted for help! 
everyone tried to help a few minutes later the paramedics and her parents showed up, i was shocked, i just left the scene as soon as i realized she was fine. and the next day guess what... the police showed up at my door, she have confessed everything on me because she was afraid of her parents, the attorney opened a case against me and the judge sentenced me 8 months in prison for sexual assault. the case was serious so i served and finished my sentence on September and i got out of jail. she used to visit me while i was in prison, she always cries and tells me she regrets everything.
this Saturday she sent a friend to tell me that she deeply regrets what she have done, she said she want to fix everything...
my morale is broken beyond repair,... i still have feelings for her, i still love her, i don't want to get into a mess but my heart tells me to forgive her and start everything fresh.

Never thought I would do this, but never say never. Let’s get to it! A guy meets a girl, isn’t that how it starts , he is one of the good guys and she is one of the shy girls. She fall in love with him for the first time. He promises love and protection. He becomes her safe home. She becomes his favorite person to hangout all the time and respect her a lot. Then, he break up with her with the popular break line. They still become close friends. After a year she found out he is celebrating two years anniversary with his girl and they are getting really serious. A girl thinks she is over him so she continues to be friend with both of them. One day the girl and the guy start hanging out as friends and started passing the line, they decided they never had a “good bye” so they do it for the last time.

Never ignore somebody if they start to talk about ending their life. Most of the time it is NOT for attention. Most of the time it is a cry for help. They are asking for somebody to show that they care. They aren't doing it to be called a poser or stupid or an attention-seeker or any other shit like that. They're saying it because they actually DO want to end it...they do actually feel the need to die. And if you just ignore them, how are you going to feel when you find out that they're dead? Think about it...just try to help the individual as much as you can.

Suicide is NOT a selfish act. You all say that they're leaving their loved ones behind and hurting them, but that really only makes you selfish. How can you expect this person to continue living through all the pain that their life is giving them? To go through the feeling of being invisible, like they have no one to confide in? To go through feeling like everybody that once loved them has now abandoned them? And to go through feeling that everyday the walls are closing in on them and that everyday they are sinking further and further into despair? Into loneliness and heartache? How on earth can you expect someone to live with that all the time, just to keep everybody else happy? It's not like it's their duty to make everyone happy. So stop being selfish yourself and think of the individual for once. 

Don't think that suicidal people don't care about you. One of the common reasons for suicide is that the individual doesn't want to hurt their loved ones anymore. And though they know that suicide may hurt their loved ones, it stops the individual from ever hurting them again. Better once than a million more times. And deep down inside, the individual probably does know that people do care, but they just can't believe that when they're feeling so down and out. It's just hard to think that people care about you when you feel that they never seem to show it and they never seem to be there when you need them most. 

If you are someone who believes in fate and God and you believe that everybody has a particular time to die made for them, then you should also believe, as sad and horrible as it may be, that suicide is meant to happen. Perhaps the individual is actually MEANT to die at this time and it just so happens that suicide is the way they die?

I've only been going out for my boyfriend for about 5 weeks and we started making out like 2 weeks ago... 
this will be a bit explicit...sorry but I kind of feel like a slut 

when we make out, it's a bit intense but we have not like had actual sex : but he doesn't just kiss my mouth but my neck and the area around my boobs or my actual boobs (not the nipple...). And we ""grind"" when kissing or whatever. Sometimes he rests his hands on my inner thighs etc.

Is this normal to do after 5 weeks? or is it a bit too early? would you describe a girl like this as ""easy"" or slut-like? 

I have no problem with it but after it happens e.g. the morning after, I feel so guilty and I feel a bit sluttish. I'm 19 and this is my first boyfriend/kiss/everything and I used to be so prudish before...I said I wouldn't kiss a boyfriend until 1 month, make out after 6 months, sex after marriage but all my views are changing and i don't like it.

I remember always having the opinion that any girl who makes out with her boyfriend before at least 6 months is a major slut and has no self respect.

I feel like I've lost my innocence a bit...I hate feeling really sluttish after a make out session because I actually really enjoy it while it happens and I really like my boyfriend...   If my parents knew what I was doing, they'd murder me - actually murder me, and that's a part of the guilt, that and the fact that I feel....no longer innocent.

Greetings fellow men, it was only a matter of time until someone took the initiative to post about how dating works in our current climate. Some of us are nice, and we think it's working against us. You then try to be asshole but that never really plays put well, does it? This post isn't for Greek god looking guys blessed with the best genes. This post isn't for the guys complaining about how their girl is too conventional in the bedroom. This post isn't for the guys who are looking to have threesomes.  This post is for the guys who just want a nice girl in their life, if they could just last until the third date, it's a success. It is awesome that we have this platform to share our thoughts we probably wouldn't share in person. For such guys, all I have to say is, hang in there. Work on yourself. Polish your skills. Don't  make your life revolve around women. Getting laid might seem the epitome of pleasure when you haven't done it, but the second you have a taste of that p***y, you soon realize it's not what it's cracked up to be. Hollywood has sold up sex and love a lot because they realized it was a good way to make money. But it's still great, don't get me wrong. My advice would be don't take social media platforms as a way to score chicks. What most guys fail to realize is that these girls are chatting up 10-20 dudes at the same time and you're just another one on the pile. You might be the cool guy she's been looking for but you honestly can't get her to commit enough to have the connection required. You do land dates using social media, but it's really not your best bet. For my fellow introverts, I understand how socializing could be a daunting task on it's own right, and add flirting with an attractive woman to the mix and it's surely doomed to fail, unless you polish your communication skills, your flirting skills. In my experience, the best way for introverts to do this is to hang in groups. Start hanging out in groups of guys and girls and the pressure is significantly less. Show your true colors, don't act like someone you're not to impress a girl, or don't say you like this or that just because she said she did. In fact, oppose her when you don't agree. Show her you are ok with, or without her. Don't reek of desperation. SHOW THAT YOU ARE A CONFIDENT MAN WHO CAN STAND ON HIS OWN TWO FEET.   By this, I do not mean be an asshole. Girls who go for the asshole are usually ones who have an insecurity of their own, beggar you would never want to see come out. Quality women can see through your bullshit, be a jerk to them and they'll shrug it off like it was nothing. These are the women you want. They don't want the asshole, they want the guy who could be an asshole if he had to. The guy who controls his asshole nature, the guys who's grown out of his assholness. These women want the guy who could protect them, but wouldn't because he knows they can take care of themselves. Aim to be this guy. You have a set of values that you live by, and you won't excuse shitty behavior from anyone. Being with you is an honor, you are a one of a kind, kinda guy. If she says something you don't like, call her out on her bullshit. The fact that you risk losing her, and could walk out at anytime says a lot about your character. It shows you want options. And EVERYONE wants the one with options, not the one kicked to the curb alone crying about being lonely. I'm sorry to break it down to you.",approval,NEGATIVE,0.9420590400695801

It's Bpd awarness week. Just wanted to share my side of story a bit. I have been diagnosed with bpd almost a year ago it has been a long road since then and the most hard part was people. Some think your attention seeker some will think your crazy and will avoid you and being alone is a big challenge. And I believe this because they don't have that much knowledge regarding mental illness as a whole.

Here is the thing.. i hate my family.. i know it sounds like im a troubled and horrible person (maybe i am) but i have my reasons.this is gonna be long but please hear me out. Ever since i was young my mother was super hard on my and always destroyed my self confidence saying i was fat and evil and i had a bad heart if i did stuff like forgetting to wash the dishes and stuff like that. She would even go out of her  way to get my friends to hate me just cuz. She once got all my friedns to ignore at my own damn birthday. Im 20 now(im female btw) and im in uni but since im learning in z same place i grew up i see her all z time and to this day she still treats me like crap. But other ppl would nvr know cuz she's super nice to others. My dad is a passive dude who wont say shit if my lil bro makes a mistake but wudd flip if i did. He still hits me to this day for shit like eg. if i open z door a lil later than he expected . I cud except z fact zat my parents r bad if they were like this to my younger sibling but no...they love him and raise way better zan they ever did with me and idk why but it makes me feel worse cuz i think ""am i really a horrible person?"" Plus z little monster is super disrespectful to me even tho im like 12 years older zan  him and my mom just loves seeing us fight (not physically)but she loves seeing him disrespecting me and treating me like shit.

I know i made a mistake being in a relationship knowing we don’t have future. At first we both agreed we don’t want to be in one but we couldn’t just stop not falling for each other. The person had no problem of having future with me but for me it means i have to lose everything i know.  I asked this person to give me time to come in terms with how i am going to go with it but this person wanted it their way which is as soon as possible. That brought the toxic side of both of us and it was just pain. I decided to end things, which hurted a lot like someone was squeezing my heart and just nothing like i have experienced before.To be honest I don’t regret it at all .

So this is my story...
I am an girl of the age of 19 and I feel like the life that I am living is not mine, it’s not the life I am meant for. I am born , raised and I live in a place  I am not supposed to be (not Ethiopia ) Since the age of 13 I wanted to move back,it was my childhood dreams and it never came true. Most of my teenager years I spent imaging the life I could have. If I wasn’t here but there. I close my eyes and see a different life and it‘s making me crazy. The dream that never came true haunts me until this day. I wonder what I would’ve been doing right now instead of what I’m doing and how much of a happier person I would’ve been. I create exact scenarios in my head. It might sound crazy to some, but I know for sure that the life in my head is really mine. But it always only existed in my head. When I was 16 everything finally lead to depression, I couldn’t deal with it anymore. I  already came to a point where I even imagined the friends I would have had or the school I would’ve had visited. It‘s unfair to me that I must live this life ... I am dead inside,  the dream that never came true killed me since I was only a kid . And I am mad yet sad because  I will never get those years of being a teenager back. And all I did was waste them with the idea of how my life could’ve been and not my real life.

I don’t know what to say.

The only thing that’s keeping me from suicide right now is that life insurance won’t pay, and I can’t come up with an appropriate method that would pass scrutiny.

So i have been getting my heart broke so many times and now i dont think i can endure it anymore.. and nope its not a guy problem.. i have always kept my expectations low with the guys and when they finally break up with me i just get a little sad for like a while and then totally forget that they even existed.. my problem is when it comes to friendship.. i am all in! like i trust people 100% i become overly attached.. demo when i say this am not one of those clingy type of people or anything i mean i dont even hug or kiss people right i am that unsociable awkward girl... its just that i always try to be nice to people i never say no menamn and people take advantage of that... esuama menem atelem menamn eyalu wede menak new yemihedut no respect at all gen yerasachew guday right?

Hello, I'm 19(M) and I live with my uncle (42). Its been 8 years since I've started living with him, he was the only one who'd take me after my parents split because neither of them were willing to take me. I dont have any siblings and my uncle has never been married so its just us two in the house. I really liked him because he was really nice to me when i was distant and quiet because of all the shit I went through with my parents . And recently I've been thinking about him a lot... I know I'm not proud of it but I dont know what to do anymore. I dont have close friends that I can talk to about these kinds of feelings. And I dont think I'm gay because I've liked girls before. But sometimes I have dreams about him and they're not totally innocent. I dont wanna be like this, but I just have these thought about him when we're alone. I haven't acted on my feelings nor do I intend to but I just can't take it anymore. I wanna be fixed. I'm disgusted by myself for thinking about these types of stuff about the man who raised me.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.98973149061203

Hi unihorse pls keep me anonymous
I wanted to vent about my mom
Since I was a child she had always yelled at me for the smallest reasons and imagine as being a child's mind it stuck to my head
I used to hear her screams at me and see horryfyimg images of thornes and me falling in them
I used to cry out a sudden and when she would ask me about it I wud just continue crying and rocking myself
As I grew up she startes criticizing my every move
The way I talked,dressed,acted and even the way I laughed
I soon lost all my confidence and constantly worried of what people would say if I acted or talked in a certain way cuz that was wat I had with her
She constantly put pressure on me and insulted me on even the smallest mistakes 
I used to go to school with red and puffy eyes from all the crying
I spent a lot of nights bawling my eyes out and asking god why i had this life and sometimes i even wanted to end it
I know she loves me and cares for me but she rarely shows it
And I really wanna tell her how she has affected me but I just can't cuz I know shed just dismiss me and see me as an ungrateful brat or sth

Hey guys,this is my first time venting so bear with me. Idk how to discuss my situation without mentioning my belief,im a Christian,born a Christian then ""lost my way"" during my adolescence n now found my way back n practicing it as much as i can. My problem is i suffer from ""O.C.P.D"" n that somehow clashes with my belief,the bible consistently tells me to not worry,to let go of my burdens n staff. yet my mind wonders around like a lost sheep,i got mood swings like u never seen before,im not happy like 90% of the time. That mental state is messing with my day to day life. I can't spend time with anyone(sleeps in all day n staff u know the drill). Now im not saying i got no one to talk to,im in a committed relation,i got a family i talk to openly n staff but the moment i mention my mental status n the sh#t im going through,all hell breaks loose. Family will tell me how i should pray n let God take care of it,girl would start to worry n even cry so i cant discuss this particular issue as much as i want,n believe me i really need to discuss my situation to get a certain level of relief u know .. Glad i shared this with you all,its not easy to discuss mental issues with strangers but seeing how so many of you are dealing with what im dealing,i figured it wont hurt .. what a relief to say that out loud,n any suggestion on how i should discuss my issues with those around me are welcomed and if any one of you would like to listen to what i have to say i would really like to chat with someone .. appreciate it big time,God bless you all",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9769246578216553

I feel like my mind is scattering in to frantic feeling. I'm not sure how venting here helps me or not, but I'm desperate, ldk what to do. So I'm 18 yrs, girl. Senior this year but things have been upside down. It started as my parents start fighting and my own dad starts to spend the night with out letting us know, he never did that before in his life. If his home they would always spend the night fighting and insulting one another. Things would have been a bit smoother  if it was only me but I've got a younger sister. She starts crying whenever they fight and they have been fighting for 6 months max. They have been together for like 20 years but they are not the same person as they used to be. Every thing has changed and I'm scared for me and my sis. What our life gonna be if they keep fighting or got a divorce. And to sum up I don't have any one to talk to, l've got friends and a boyfriend. But Every time I tell them they were fighting they would say ""every thing is gonna be alright "" but it's not. I'll be taking the matric this yr but I'ven't been concentrating on school and it's really affect my result  and I'ven't been my real self lately. I started faking like l'm fine so that my mom, friends and other ppl could be a bit happier when I'm around. But I'm so broke inside... and no body seems to notice.

I've been dating this guy for about 4 months now. We've known each other for about 5 years. We dated briefly like 3 years ago but decided to stay friends. The thing is I don't feel like there's really anything between us. No chemistry at all. I think we're staying together because we both don't want to lose each other as a friend. By dating we destroyed our friendship.  I mean what's the point of dating, if I'm not sharing my thoughts with him, turning to him for help or calling him at the mildest inconvenience I face. I think the dating made us lose our friendship.  I honestly thought we would remain friends even if we were dating now. When I decided to confess this wasn't what I had in mind. He was my friend of 5 years I never thought it'd be this awkward between us. The worst thing about is sometimes we'd go on for weeks without meeting or calling eachother and it wouldn't even bother me until we meet online and talk about how long it has been. I really want to end it gn I don't know how to. Plus I feel bad because I was the one who broke it off  last time too.

Hello 
Ever since we were kids(me and my brother) our mother were sick sometime she gets better but not that much.This goes on til i get to university. When i was 2nd year i came home for x-mass my dad open the door, we hug and say hi whereas my mom was sitting on the porch she was excited while looking else where i approched to say hi and she was looking at me like she can't see me and she missed to hold  my hand. my hole world colapsed that day i was complaning why did god make my mama sick and now this. She have gone to a hospital and the doctor says its all fine nd nothing is wrong with her eyes just like they always say even i know its n't true. Back then they gave her medicine to ease the pain they say but it did nothing. I hated my life more than ever it crushed my soul. My mom's suffering goes back before i was born she had a miscarriage which cause her both physical and emotional pain and that wasn't enough tho one day we was just kids ~3&~5 my mom gat sick and rushed to the hospital and the doctors said they need  to repair unwanted ruptured area so she needs surgery my dad was on duty some were in barren area(he was a solider) they did the surgery while she was pregnant and they cause a second miscarrage which she uner goes the experience of physical and emotional pain for the second time. Long story short she been blind ever since(~4). This all suffering made me an interovert & strong (i even can make injera,wet, mename ) but this all stole my childhood i don't even have a bestfreind.

I don't have a lot of time to write it all down so bare with me if it doesnt make complete sense. The thing is a girl I've known for a while now a little while ago told me that she had a crush on a good frnd of mine and like any good wingman would do i tried to set them up. A few nights together as a threesome we went out clubbing and had a pretty good time. One of those nights smth just happened bn me and her n we ended up sleeping together and ever since then me and her have been hanging out casually. Now the problem is the frnd i set her up with is still in the picture, ik for a fact that they still talk and hangout. I've asked him if he's serious about her and he told me they haven't done anything physical but that he likes her. He doesnt know that we hooked up or that we've been hanging out, i for one don't have deep feelings for her but i do enjoy her company.}I can't rly blame her for talking to both of us cuz, she doesnt owe us anything plus we've all been in that situation of being caught bn 2 or more ppl so it's not her fault. Ik i can't just go on like this cuz at some point something is bound to go wrong and i honestly care for the both of them.

I don't think it's some psychological problem but it's really not normal. It feels like someone I really loved for so long got struck by a lightning everytime I notice the time status. It's as if Time was so fast this morning that it made me anxious and now at night it's so slow it depresses me. Or vice versa. I tried to get help by telling my friend but she reacted the same way any of your friends would react to "" I'm not sure which dress to choose""
In other words, she taught I was just overstressed about academic things and started telling me to start studying without programs but I never did study with programs. She just scrubbed away the conversation.  I want to be frank...  no one I know can help me overcome this. Almost all the people in my life have a mindset that if you see things in a different way they can get easier. But I tried and failed miserably so many times. I need help from you. I can't sleep, do things properly or even hang out with my friends. I watch the minutes left evertime I watch movies and listen to even like 3 minute songs. I feel old and other days I feel like I'm way too young to do some things [in a negative way btw I get the idea that I'm too young to apply for scholarships, date, save money and etc] No one seems worried about me except for me.

Hey Unicorn
Pleasee hide my identity
When I was a kid this guy used to live with us and he worked for my parents
I was like 6/7 maybe and he was 22/23 years old
He used to manipulate me into taking off my clothes and going on his bed in his room
I was just a child and I didn't know what was happening
This went on and he started to finger me
It was painful but I was too afraid to say anything
After a few years I started realizing what had been done to me and I felt violated and dirty
But I was still afraid to say anything
The guy still works with NY parents and he even got married and has two children now
About two months ago I saw him and all those things just came back to me
And I just wish that he would suffer and feel the utmost pain ever imaginable
I know this might make me sound like a bad person but i just wish he dies",fear,NEGATIVE,0.9974198341369629

Well guys, start off I'm not a venting type but I thought I needed it now so just hear me out, I learnt in girls school (no boys) hell! I used to feel confident about myself, I could easily notice people getting inlove.. But when it comes to lying I lie so much it feels like a habit(l lie abt my name, my home abt my frds like almost every thing) so no one knows me(the true me) but it feels so fuckin good..specially to the rumors and they believe me even though it doesn't feel real(I had a terrible time remembering my lies)I am super careless I don't give a shit about anything.. I hock up with different guys but I don't give a shit.. But this was before I met this guy he is so controlled and satisfied with everything, he is super careless like me.. We were so close i have never been that close to anyone he used to ask so many question.. So then as always I lied.. Then when he found out I lied again it eerie right... I know most of u r saying its ur fault bla bla.. But I realized that I was lying when he told me that I was lying, its sick right its how far my lying habit has gone its inside me I can't function with out it(I bet no one doesn't hv this problem).. So we broke up saying he is over with my sick lying habit and that ive hurt him so bad that he will nvr forgive me, I know its all my fault I do feel guilty, I feel bad about it all, I am fucked up..

Helluuu readers hope everyone had a lovely day. My question is directed to Christians, since I think you guys will understand my situation better, but non-believers feel free to share your oppinion too.  So, lately the sermons I've attended at church keep talking about how my life has to revolve around Jesus and basically christianity and not the other way around. The thing is, I have things in my life that I'm so compasionate about I could eventually develope them into a career, but I'm worried it might take my intention away from my religion. At the time I really wanted to pursue these dreams I really didn't take anything else, including my religion, seriously. I sorta lost hope after.. due to well... certain personal issues(yes, I did have a montage flash back of all the bad things in my life that hindered me from living the way I wanted to..), but now that I've gained it again it's not easy keeping track of what I should do, and what I feel, I'm lost hehe.

I don't want to sound cliche but I'm in a point where I am constantly questioning my sanity and value. A couple weeks ago I watched a video about a guy named Frank Abignale and I was moved by the confidence he had in himself. What really caught my attention about his story was when he said ""the very moment you start doubting yourself people will notice"", now after listening to this I started implimenting this in my life and so I did. The only problem of implimenting other people's philosophy is that it might not work for you. And that's what happened in my case. It was all fake. Fake confidence sold by a con man. Now, I am starting to lose my self. With no guide in this vast world, I realized that there isn't really anywhere to go. Society, Class, Religion, Art, Culture, Politics .... what does they all mean?

First time venting here. I want to really change. But change needs a great deal of time and energy. But my energy is being wasted on compulsive masturbation(like 5 years), porn and video games. I want to seek help but the topic in its self is considered taboo in our culture. I have tried a lot of times to stop but I always get back at it. Specially the sex oriented movies in hollywood are like my triggers. I instantly think abt it and do it when sex is mentioned in any media. For those of u who are going to argue masturbation is okay and healthy I promise u its not, u constantly think abt woman only in sexual perspective not as a human being and u distance Ur self from social interactions(at least that's what I did). So what should I do?(my issue is relatively light compared to the once I saw in this channel. But doesnt mean I dont need help)",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9768772125244141

Hey guys. Here's the rub... I've struggled with depression like symptoms(i say like because I've not been diagnosed and i know the term is not one to be used lightly)for a while to the point where i was self harming and had constant suicidal thoughts. And that ultimately cost me a future with a girl i loved a lot. Since then I've been trying to put myself back togther and be better. And since met an awesome girl whom i care about but the problem is its back again and i feel crappy and drained. And it makes me push people away or do reckless things to sabotage it.

Here, as usual it about my bf, we used to be friends then it finally turned to a r/ship as usual, so he used to help me in lots of things, he was sweet, he found me a job (I'm 19, finished school learning in Uni) but I did something that he hates the most, and finally his friend told him, in front of me, but he was quite, in a weird wayever(he stood there frozen as if he saw a ghost) he didn't shout at me, even though I wanted him too(he knows it), so then I would have asked forgiveness but he left the room with out a word, as if he didn't care.

Then he started being odd not the real him.

So as neighbor's we see eachother(we don't talkany more) everytime I think of forgiving him, I see his eyes they are deep red, like he has been biting himself up or fighting with someone, i see him smoking when he see sees me he hides, he comes late at night and sometimes he knocks our door, and when my parents open it, I act like I don't know him and his somedrank that accidentally knocked our door, its like nvr before and I'm getting scared for him and me too.

And I know that he stopped talking to his friends and family, he is out of everything, he deleted his telegram account and facebook, I don't know what's happening.

Last time I was with my friend (boy) I felt his eyes on my back, zore ayehut, he was looking at me keza he turned around.

Then next day my friend was avoiding me minamn in a weird way, he didn't talk, he was so silent, he avoided me after that.

So that was when I get really frightened.

Wtf if up with reporting a comment and getting banned if its not sensitive enough its freaking idiotic in my opinion. 

Whats the point of it all if u can't give a comment from ur point of view it maybe harsh to some people gin its still a comment.

On what basis are the comments deimed insensitive.

in my comments i said im not a fanatic of any religious ideology  and i hate people that force other into their ideology like their view is the righteous one and other peoples view aren't worth shit and some other blah blah and the i get a notice of the above text 

What made vent interesting was its freedom of speech and anonymity but now giving a comment is harsh and u will get banned for ur belief and ideology. So u gotta keep it nice and smiley face and shit. 

Whats next?
Are gonna censor everyones vents and if they are not sensitive enough and or are abit different that popular opinion are u gonna ban us. Whats the point of it all then

Crying like all the air getting out was staying in and I had to force it out (awful metaphor huh) and I felt awful about it when I woke up. Since that dream I swear I'm so worried about him. He's safe and okay I guess but I still medeneget Everytime I feel like he's in danger. I told him and he obviously laughed at me. But I'm serious. I can't sleep without sending him 50 texts about how much I love him and I call every other hour which is obsessive and making him get scared a little. I even hug him tighter now.

Part two...here it goes 
Some days feel sunny and some feels so dark. I can barely smile from i side. Nothing is getting better i am and always be the girl who's raped, living in a divorced family, paying for her dad's sin, being responsible and working my ass as hard as I can to satisfy my mom and make her proud at my coast. I never succeeded tho. Am never enough for her. That's what she always say am godolo. I don't really know which part of me is like that. Am the one who washes clothe, cook all the food for 5 people, sometimes injera megager and as usual cleaning all the house. Only servants can understand how long this could take and how much tiring it is. And still i don't complain but she does. What matters the most is not me cleaning the whole fucking house, it's changing the place of the remote. I don't expect her to thank me but she can atleast not annoy me. I hate saturday afternoon and Sunday so bad. It's like nobody gives a fuck about how am doing. Nobody ever asked I wanna cry i really wanna cry i need someone to ask me how am really doing. And no one is out there. My dad bearly sees me. I litrally begged him to come and see me but the last time i saw him was for 5 mins he was in the car I just said hi from outside he didn't even hug me 2 month ago. What should I call him?

Hola people, I am 24 and I'm GC this year. 
I couldn't forget my ex which I dumbed him 2mon before. after being together for 3mon but I meet him on FB and we used to chat for 3mon before he came to Ethiopia. After he came here we used to hang out and even make love. But then I started to notice he doesn't talk about us like what he's looking from this r/n or about our future.
I asked him one day about it and he told me that he's busy with many staffs and want to settle first and he said I'm still asking myself that am I ready to be your man and am I ready to give you what you deserve. So I gave him 1 more mon and see him but really does this thing needs time to be with some one? B/c we meet only for sex once per week (Which doesn't gave me comfort) and he calls me 2x per day and talk about how we spend the day. So i asked him if he's looking for physical thing only or a r/n. He was very angry and told me its for r/n And asked me what to do and that he's confused. It was a damn answer So I told him that if this is for nothing I don't want to waste my time since I'm a medical student am busy too and then we break up. But he asked me not to block him and to be friends with him. I told him not to contact me anymore but he still calls me every week since we break up. I talk to him only once. 

My question is what do you think i should do? I mean I felt like I have been fooled or used. I care a lot for my feelings I don't want those uncomfortable times to be repeated. 
I need advice from matured one's and especially from those who have experience in r/n ship.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9902532696723938

This isn't a confession or a secret. I just need advice or opinion on something. There is this guy am friend's with. We have only known each other for about a year but we have so many, so many mutual friends. And ever since we met both our friends started to make fun of us saying we like each other and stuff. I have a crush on him. I know that. But I don't know if he likes me back. He is about 15 years older than me and most of my friends. I am in my early 20's and he is 36. He is very shy and he an introvert. Am an introvert too but not as much as him. He just goes to work and comes home. He doesn't gout with his friend's or anything. I usually see him at his workplace or at home. He calls me all th time, and we talk for the whole night. He texts me everyday, he buys me stuff, he is so nice to me. He helps me with things a lot. And I can't tell if he likes me or he is just being nice to me as a friend. I thought about talking to him about what's going between us. But that can't be an option because I might lose him as friend. And he isn't the type of person to take things well if it turns out am wrong. So I need advice. What should I do?

Here's the deal. I have liked someone before. But we couldn't be together because of some shit and so we nothing happened. A year after this thing, someone asked me out and I said yes so we started dating. I didn't say yes because I liked him but because I felt bad for him (I could tell he really liked me). After dating for 6 months (I was so happy with him and I liked him in the 6 months), I asked for a break up. I don't know why I did but I really hated him. He did nothing but I hated him anyway. A month after we broke up, someone kissed me, it never turned into something, I pushed away the person and it ended. And another year later, I started making out with another person but still he was not my boyfriend . (He kissed me first but I was going through a lot of shit that I needed the kissing to numb all the pain). But I told him to stop and we don't make out anymore. Now it's been a year and half since it was over with my ex. But he's still in love and I kinda want him but I'm scared that I will hurt him again and I'm not confident that I won't leave him again. 
And some additional info, I'm gobez temari who's got the looks, who scored the best matric result in highschool mnamn and the boy is not that good looking and is not that good with school. So let me ask you few questions that I can't answer. 
1. I don't really know why I wanted to break up, why do you think it is? It is because I'm a lot more beautiful and smart, or is it because I still like the guy I couldn't date, or what is it?
2. Does making out with 3 guys make me a slut? Every time I think about it, I hate myself. 
Please don't rush to judge me. I have myself to do that. I have been judging myself for the past 1 year and now I just want your opinion. Please help me, put yourself in my shoes and tell me what you would do.",disappointment,NEGATIVE,0.9938395619392395

Am a virgin girl at the age of 30 ( about to hit 31 next month ) and the weird thing is that I have never been with a guy before.

A lot of shits are bothering me at this moment, like for the first time am In a real relationship but that doesn't seem to work either. Am starting to get so lonely and stuff..... I feel used all the time. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of friends but they don't seem to be around when I need them. Even my so called gf is not there when I need her. I'm starting to wonder there's no one for me in this world. I'm thinking about ending my relation with her coz I don't think she loves me anymore. To be real I don't think anyone loves me anymore. My question is can u force someone to love u? Or continue to be with u? 
What would u do if suddenly the person u love starts acting weird?

Okay here goes. There was a point in my life where i pretty much didn't believe in anyone or anything. Where i believed that u stand up for yourself and noone else can do it for you. A while back someone disproved me. This person came into my life, and something about said person made me break down walls i put up thinking id never put them down again. Felt really strange at first. Feeling vulnerable, but better to have loved and lived than never loved at all. I guess i completley fell for said person and I'll do right by them no matter what. So don't half ass your relationships. Either commit to the other person or don't. Stop hurting the ones who care about you, friends and don't be toxic towards your happiness and others. World would be much more beautiful if we all just took care of eachother. May seem naive to you or whatnot but sooner or later you'll meet the sort of people who would die for you. Be it boy or girlfriends, friends or family. Just look for the good in everything you do. And my person, well thank you. You've made me happier than i thought possible and I'll always do right by you, and love you. Because of you i see the world in colour and you deserve the world for that.

And school sucks too, every one makes fun of me by the things I say or do, l'm not getting good grades but I've to in order to get my dream job however I'm lacking motivation this days .

Hello everyone well am not that much of venter type but here i go now,
I am a guy who never loved any girl before, ofcourse i had girlfriends, but never felt the love,
But now i really felt what love is like, with out her i get bored, telegram feels like first day of a new class, its like there are dozens of people i can talk to but only enjoyed her company.
Although i used to be a guy who let his emotions burry rather than letting it out, but now, Yes, i loved her, i was willing to give away anything and throw away any relations just so i can have her. But guess what she has a bf, and her bf loves her too, i guess  
Then i made a move so i can pull my self out of the friend zone and i got her answer which was not good, and ever since then our relation kinda collapsed on me, i regret every single step which led me to loving her. I think of being the old me who always run away from love but always find my self on a treadmill of still wanting her.

For the first time in my life, i loved this girl, but she was wrong, 
Idk what to do, whether to move on or live in a false little world of ""Me n her""

I don't know why you come to this site and share your darkest problems(sucidal , depression  etc.. bicha serious problems). Btw lots of people have them. Is it just a vent or seeking  advice from strangers?
 If the latter .
 Some may tell you a good solution here  but you wouldn't understand it because it doesn't fit your exact situation . A good solution always  comes from within . It can originate from people who truly understand you , It may be your close friends or family or yourself. But you shouldn't really expect much from strangers we feel Empathy but we can't help you truly. Learn to Use all your tools wisely like the internet ,friends , whatever etc.. . To help you.

And  Never ever  compare yourself to others because we humans are not intrested in others frowns only their smiles(we are envious in nature)

Even the psychiatry  is an option sometime the brain gets physically injured and can't be fixed by advice don't shy away from it. 
Remember we got one life and you could be smiling through it instead of crying. When you grow up the value of a smile is much higher so  you have to up your game.
No matter how crazy you feel your situation is. You more or less can get through almost anything it is a fact( not just to motivate you and shit).
U are a human and your a surviver it is in our genes.(fight smart and it will look effortless).

When depressed, be depressed. Simply be depressed. Don’t
get depressed about your depression. When depressed,
simply be depressed. Don’t fight it, don’t create any diversion; don’t force it to go. Just allow it to happen, it will go by itself. Life is a flux, nothing remains.

Meaning of vent a strong expression of some sort of emotion u feel, this channel is named after this noun and for sure I am reading all of this anxious, depressed, socially awkward people, introverts actually speaking their mind in this open media, sexually driven people always talking about how their relationship has failed or how they are so scared of talking to this girl/boy he/she likes or how they are so self-conscious about their imperfections they feel threatened or insecure about the opposite gender.......so all these people I just wrote about are just me more or less. Am 19, 2 year student and to be honest I have no different story to tell from the thousands of people that have been on this channel, I just wanted to say stuff of my mind to just feel the relief it brings me. I have always been stuck in between doing the right thing and doing the thing I wanna do so as u can guess my life is quite dreary what can I say my conscious have out grown my childhood hopes and dreams. But to all the people feeling what can't actually be expressed by words I say to u maybe it's okay to feel this way and we might actually make it.

Alright, now im reaally having a headache thinking about it.
Im a boy, 20 years old 3rd year student. And i want to share my story. I think sharing would ease my thinkings in someway so here i go.
First of all, i didnt grew up here in this country(gn with all its flaws i still love My homeland). Ena In my highschool days, i was a nerd, a weirdo in someways and had some hard times, from heartbreaking to family issues. Just after that, i turned my focus completly to learning. With that purpose, i was good at what i was doing ena i got to campus. Here it begins, i feel like ive hitted rock bottom and i cant get out of it. Mn libelachu, everything makes me upset and start questioning myself, ""Why i cant be like anyone? Have a relationship, live my fuckin life"". So yup, my friends had 2 relationships but me still there. I get really jealous of couples walking. Sometimes it doesnt bother me *reached to that point *. And the other purpose what im not living my life is family issues. My dad is an addict. And im living by the hands of my mom ""Momma, may Allah strengthen you and i will never ever forget what you did"". Ena my relatives know that im nerd so they just tell me to focus on my studies. I want to burst out, im fuckin serious. Im an introvert so i dont talk things like that. People think that im good. I really help people alot, from dormmates, to my neighbours, Sometimes i do peoples assignments for free and my groupmates are lucky enough. Ena yemilachehu nger yemiredagn sw atahu.

so here's the shit like a few months ago I was hanging with my bestie after class and my ex came up and started hanging with us. When we got a moment alone my ex(let's just call him ex) asked me to leave so he could hang wiz my friend(let's just call her bestie). When I asked him abt it later ex told me that he had a thing for bestie and that he wanted to date her. A fee days later I told bestie about it and she laughed saying it would never happen and she would never do that to me. Then over the last month or so I noticed they got closer and closer but I ignored it since she swore there was ntn goin on and i knew he was perusing her.
Then today while I was talking with bestie I asked her wat was new and she was like oh well I'm kinda dating ex. My immediate rxn was excitement since she hadn't dated in a long time and I was totally over him. But the more I thought about it the more I realized that she had been lying to me for weeks saying it was never gonna happen. And Its not that I'm not okay with them dating but I feel like she should have talked to me before starting it. Cuz like she just acted like it didn't really matter to her how I would feel about her dating my ex she didn't even ask if I was cool with it or if I was totally over him.
And here's the thing about ex when we dated it was totally casual. we just hung out and smoked weed we never really got emotional n shit. But after we ended things me and him became friends and we got really close. Like I ended up telling him shit I'd never told anyone. But like after I opened up to him he freaked out cuz we'd tlked and personal shit. So basically he was a shitty boyfriend and an equally shittg(though in other ways) friend. So it didn't really come as a surprise to me that he wouldn't care how I felt cuz I had long accepted that he didn't care about me but it hurts to realize that she doesn't really care about me either. So I guess now I'm wondering should I just tlk to her about how I'm feeling cuz I don't think it will make much of a difference. or should I just ignore it until it goes away and pretend like ntn is wrong?",realization,NEGATIVE,0.9987698197364807

Part of me wants to see u again, to hold u again to kiss u again but all of those feelings become empty thoughts when i look back now remembering that love isn't always what it seems. it's just so easy to forget but this isn't regret we have our reasons for ending it and they are as valid as ever but back at the start we didn't need any reasons to fall in love we just did. The reasons came at the end and everything since then has been about reasons and that is good it means that one day I'll find someone who i won't have to say goodbye to but a part of me just misses loving someone and having them love you back that's all.

Okay....

I recently went through a breakup(last sat 2 be accurate) and it wasn't rly nice....me and her actually were doing good or so I've thought. We were few months in and It was actually starting 2 feel real and stuff. And we got drifted a bit due 2 class...I'm fresh in college and she's in prep so yea we both were busy and all But all of a sudden she ended it through text saying this was too much, that she didn't wanna commit and stuff. but she told me I didn't do anything wrong and all but I was rly broken like I immediately felt down but I did respect her decision cuz simply I don't wanna force her into changing her mind(feelings).and I did care 4 the girl more than anyone In my life...so I let her go. And uk the drill after that...I still wanna be friends stuff came up and I agreed...thinking I'll get over it but it's been only a week(a very longggg one) and I feel like shit....like some one drilled a hole in my chest and just didn't know what 2 do next so the hole is just....there. It's like she tore me but 2 one piece. Like ik I would never get her back...ik she'll never be mine again but fuck it I miss her a lot... I miss the days we used 2 talk till midnight, I miss her laugh...I miss her annoying jokes, her calls, her voice, her warm touch,...those slight wrinkles on her nose when she laughs,...ik...ik it's really pathetic and sad trust me I see it too but idk....I just miss her. I tell her I'm good but I'm not doing well. But I she is over me tho her friends made it clear...and I'm happy abt that. But I can't shake the feeling that we might fix things up and shit...but ik it'll never go back 2 the way it was but idk......I don't think I'll ever feel 4 any girl in my life like I felt 4 her...I lose interest like immediately when they approach me. And uk how homies are... Saying I shld get out more, hook up zem beleh, just have fun, movie suggestions and I'm trying the go out more and movies cuz being alone is getting harder by the day....and tho It's rly bad thr is still some part of me left that would still take her back and I just hate myself 4 that..... so let me stop right here and just ask any of u guys for advice. Shld I fight 4 her?, or maybe give it time?...anything u would like  2 suggest I'm all ears.

1. Cheap dates more that 2,3 times am telling u ladies if a man truly likes u he would wanna take u some where valuable and wanna spend money on u.
Have ur standards ladies lets not settle for less
2. Doesnt care if you know his messing with other girls and he be calling her a friend n shit trust me she might be his girl and your gonna be the side dish
3. He be making u feel so good by  calling you wifey n shit but isnt actually there for you when u need him and he keeps on sayin he was busy and makes u feel guily for his own mistake am tellin you sis if your dealing with such kinda of guy know his all about the vagina thats why he always wanna comfort you with his words thats a red sign baby 
What you got down there is a gift dont just give the cookie to every one let them pray fast and wait for it you gotta take care  of what gets into your body not just foods honey
3. Doesn't have anything special for you and always insists you to come to his crib,he be like we can watch movie and cuddle you know whats comes after that sex and u might not be ready for that am tellin u if u wanna go to a man house for Netflix or whatever it should be for someone who actually is ur guy and u actually trust him bcuz ladies he be callin ur ass to his house so he wont take u on a real date and he just wanna smash that ass
4. His only interested when u talk about sexual things 
5. His not constant one day he texts and then disappears for days and come back and tell you he was busy and he might not even give a reason

Girls this days are easy to throw it back but trust me it makes ur dating life exiting build ur bond first then ur gonna be the person he wanna settle with he might get another girl with good kitty kat but what u gonna have with him is gonna be different sis
2. Be spontaneous do little cute things for him... dont just be all about urself... its okay to cater for your man and dont be hard and aggressive guys dont like that and let him be the man dont be controlling. you might meet up with him after school or work or you go to his house and he told you he just come from work or he just wanna play video games or wanna lay down and listen music dont get on his nerves give him space dont keep nagging him he might have a bad day and build that bond know what he likes do all the little things to make him happy and i promise his gonna do the samebut keep in mind don't do it to the point that he will use you and  be sure his the right guy
3. Dont be clingy give him time to miss you dont be texting and calling him every sec give the guy a break uk how we are when we like someone but lets control that and give him time to miss you honey

Now I'm starting to lose weight. And my motivation is the guy who used to bully me for my weight although I had a crush on him and I still do. And I know this is stupid. And I pep talk myself to go on and forget him because he Ain't worth it. But I swear when I think of something else to lose weight for I find myself eating a bag of chips. It's as if dating him is only accomplished by losing weight. I have to stop thinking that losing weight will be an abracadabra for all my problems. I need you all to make me forget him.

All the people you see on the internet especially Ethiopian artists living lavish and shit. And making you feel like you have done nothing in your life. Don't buy that shit.

She is famous ,most of u know her but am not saying her name but her whole life is a lie,she lie about her age,her educational status,her family's work,her life style and she literally is denying where she came from and who she  actually is and I think she is in denial! She doesn't listen to nobody reminding her of the reality even her own mom. She is forever 21 but she actually is way way older than that. its a sick game and I fucking hate to lie and she make me lie about everything too to her friends and most people that knows her. And am tired of forever lying to people. I have to lie about my age too so that it would make sense when I say am her younger sister. and am not that kinda person. I hate to lie about something that i don't even consider as a big deal. So I  purposely distance myself from genuinely good people that knows both of us cuz am tired of the lie cuz she lies about everything. And its hard to keep track of that.

Anyhoo, let me further elaborate on what I meant by my previous vent. 40% to 50% of married couples in the USA divorce. Why is that? Maybe it’s because one cheated, one could’ve lied about something big, or they simply fell out of love for example ‍ Now, I absolutely love my family and I love my friends, but will I ever love someone as more than that? Idk. How will I ever be sure that that one person I share my heart to, won’t leave for someone else? How will I be sure they won’t do anything behind my back? Because yes, humans are social animals but we’re also natural liars. And besides that, us humans we do get lonely even when we have someone that loves us, we crave for something that we might never find! We’re always looking for the most compatible person to us,but why don’t we work on ourselves first? Be the best version that we can be for US? All I’m saying is why would we need someone to complete us when we should be complete by ourselves already? Why should your whole happiness depend on someone else?

But a smart person is one that learns and takes the knowledge from the no one and turns it to wine. Anyway, I feel like most of the people here are mirroring eachother. Thats why it’s depression this and depression that. I think the major reason is caused by the brainwashing of the media. You know what I mean. That song that makes pain and depression sound cool. The sad songs that are trendy nowadays. They are artists they paint. So all of you read into that and boom you’re depressed. All I can say to that is read a book. Not fiction stuff but actual books about the human brain. Read about philosophy and evolution. Pain is not your reality. You are in control. If you are depressed just acknowledge it. Don’t fight. Then let it go. 
Then there’s the people who are in love and shit like that. And they complain or ask for advice. To you I say, love isn’t what you think it is. Again movies fuck us up. Rachel and Ross bullshit. Love is defined by the partners. So define it. If it doesn’t work out then move on
The best thing I can tell you tho is none of it matters. Just be aware of your life. Live and be happy just being alive. Really take a break. Breathe. Let it all go. Find a silence in your brain. Take control",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9691537022590637

I'm working really hard to bring my grades up but I'm getting discouraged because all my hard work seems to be for nothing. Maybe I'm not meant for this... Maybe i just can't keep up with my class mates.

He proved in many ways that hurt my feelings. Although I never even expressed them. He stopped talking to me all of a sudden (in 7th grade) and also in 8th grade. He used to hurt me (mentally and physically) so it was okay for me but I liked him. Even then. Then when I got into the 9th grade... My location and his location got drifted apart and now, after like 5 years, I see him everyday (at a taxi Tera) but I still haven't talked to him since 7th grade (aka for 5 years). I still love him.

Rumors.......they're as hard as cancer .....means have no cure....like zero cure. At least cancer have chemotherapy and there's chance to be free by it....rumor doesn't....If the rumor is about u, u can't stop it. All u have to do is sit and watch people spread that shitty thing. U can't do anything. All u have to do is ignore it because u know urself that u didn't do what they say u did and laugh about it than processing it through ur mind and let it eat u alive. 

Why rumors started 
1. They hate u, with no fucking apparent reason 
2. U have sth what they don't have
3. They can't get through ur level 
 So, the weapon they have is to badmouth u....but it'll only be a weapon if u let it be a weapon. I mean, if u don't process it through u mind, it definitely won't be a weapon....

So I'm campus student at somewhere, and I'm in the crisis of rumors. I'm so famous by that u have no idea   the rumor is that I'm a whore, they're telling that I slept with all of the guys from my campus and boys think that's true and they come with what they have to make me fall in love with them.....It's not bragging about myself but I'm cold hearted. I don't take their shits so I'm stubborn as hell...and most of my friends are boys so I know each and every move, if it's real or fake....so when what they heard and what they found becomes different they'll say 'but I heard different thing about u thought u were really a whore' WELL THEN BITCH U SHOULD STOP LISTENING TO THEM
 
This was my most time routine......and I never gave a damn about that....until I met a guy, we fell for each other. I like him he likes me.....but he kept listening to these rumors and he be mad about it....got into couple of fights because of that. He knows that I'm 
not like that....but deep down he don't trust me....especially when we don't meet, he thinks I'm out there kissing some random guys while I'm sitting in my bed with bag of chips watching my favorite movie.....he hurt my feelings several times  like he called and say where are u and when I told him I'm at my bedroom he says u lying, u are out screwing someone, the rumor is true mnamn....and I hang up the phone....next day he said I'm sorry.....I forgive him and the viscous cycle goes on

2020-01-07 20:57:11,"Suicide is not the answer. I know life is hard and as a guy who has lost too many people to suicide, I'm here to say we need to come up with a better way of reviving the spirits of our youth. Because unless you live inside a cave, your life isn't just yours. It's tied together with so many people's;your friends, your family or even with a complete stranger. Your death will affect them in ways you can't possible imagine and not just any death, it's suicide. Do you know what kind of burden that would be ? To leave your parents wondering what thing could they have done differently to make you wanna stay alive and this burden and guilt never gets any easier. People who keep having suicidal thoughts should seek help immediately because I genuinely believe nobody can be broken beyond repair. Just trust that someone cares because someone actually does. Do not choose an easy way out which will most definitely result in you going to hell for all eternity. There are people who dedicate their lives to help people in such unfortunate circumstances. They should be able to help. We all have purposes in our lives and imagine a teenager killing herself, that means her purpose remains unfulfilled. Many people's lives may have been tied to her purpose. Maybe she was meant to open a huge rehab center or a charity organization. Or maybe she was even meant to a prime minister. I'm just saying we all need each other. So instead of encouraging suicide,let's help each other get better and strong. Our parents need us. Our friends need us. Our community needs us.

HIDE MY IDENTITY 
I need to fucken vent
Am a 21 years old man campus student who used to learn in regional university & recently transferred to Addis. I luv ma girlfriend 2 death, atleast I thought I did. We met in highskl & at 1st she didn't show no interest in me but through time I worked my magic & we became amazing couples.We share many personalities & behaviors which  partly its helping us to be together to this day & partly making it hard for us. We both r hot tempered & a bit aggressive leading us to our on & offs in our relationship but we both r extremely loyal to each other. We have been in on & off relationship together for 6 years and half now. I was even completely loyal in our distance relationship times but know am going through a fucking hard time because of this new girl. I only know her for 4 months & we met in my new school & she is just one of a kind. She is extremely cute, funny, very polite & friendly(unlike my girl),caring & also humble.We 1st started to talk because we were sitting near to each other in our classroom, then I learned that her house is on z way to my house(but in a different location) so I started giving her rides. First it was on our way back from class but now we go to class & back from it together . We started having lunches together,inviting each other movies on exam post days then having drinks & going to clubs together & alone from z rest of our classmates.Nothing has happened between us & she knows I have a gf but she is giving me clear sign & vibes she is interested. I started canceling appointments with my gf to meet with  my new indulgence & I hv done this repeatedly to a point where my gf asks why r u being extra busy lately. What am about to say will make me sound like an asshole but I even think of her when we have our intimate physical moments with my gf including sex. I tried 2 get rid off my viceful thoughts but I can't.I tried my  best to avoid her out of school but the maximum I could do was 4 long & booring days. Anybody who knows me close knows that I'm a loyal to death(I'm a guy who used to consider talking online to other girls is cheating)when it comes to relationship so it's really hard for me to ask anyone I know for advice and the new girl is increasing her attachment with me as our days progress.

So they releases their music with that freq and it messes our mind. I heard some ethiopian dude on melkam wetat speakin bout this app that makes you see another eviler version of yourself and stuff and that person you see sins mnamn does bad things but your real self feels bad about it. So i believe the 440 freq connects you with that personality. Trust me ive spent months researching this. Even found xxx tentacion revealing their secret and stuff. So yeah you feel a little depressed and hear sad trap songs to ease the pain but it makes it worse and the worst part is that you wont even know its doing it. So there is an app called 432 player app so i recommend you download that and play your music through that player. You will start to see the d/ce in like a week or two.

 Ever Since I remember I was scared of men do not tell me that I have those issues because of my father or any fatherly figure in my life because my father is the best thing that ever happen to me and he has nothing to do with this behavior of mine.  For example I may be talking with a guy in telegram or sth and I really liked him and he liked me to but as soon as the chat turns from friendly to flirting I panic I literally shake and I can't breath my heart beats like crazy and my mouth quivers i and create a stupid reason   to flake. You can see how awkward it is when he is your class mate like you were doing just fine and you made a friend minamin and the next day you ignore him even avoid eye contact even if you know his eyes were on you the whole time its not that I Dont want its that I'm scared  and anxious about what the next thing will be and to tell you what that has gotten me I have never had a guy friend and I really want to have one day and obviously i have never had a boyfriend(my soulmate  I know I'm crazy ) which I want to have and also have  chances with great guys which I obviously blow.

For the past  1 year my life is becoming miserable. It changed suddenly. I am depressed, obssesed, overthinking about everything, can't communicate with people, i always look down or appear to have weird gesture while talking with people, lost my confidence mnamn. What makes it worse is that i dont have a real friend. even my family, they love me, they care for me gn they don't know what i really feel. I always keep silent in home. I am going to take my exams this week. I feel like i am going to fail and get kicked out because i didn't read. My family invested everything they have on me. They have no other children. I am the only one.  I remember that my father cant keep his tears when he heard my result when i passed my enterance exam with a good grade.
 i am now starting to pray for death. I am not suicidal but i feel like i have no purpose to live.
I am in desperate need of someone who can help. I want to meet with someone new(preferably girls) who can build trust with me and becomes a real friend.Bicha i dont know what to do. i dont know who can help me

I'm a 12 grade student. I wanna vent about something. It is not considered as a problem. And is a silly thing.
I just....I can't help the ones I love. I couldn't many times and u still can't. Their lives is so messed up.VERY. they some real shit going on with their lives. I know everyone has that but it's to many for them to handle. And they are so lonely desperately. All they have is me. I am the only one they have. They tell me everything. When something bad happens or about their feelings.... And what do I do? Just sit and listen. That's all. No action. I just have ears. I give them advice or talk to them about it but I don't even think that it's the the advice they should listen to. I am no use to them. Like at all. Its been so long and when they get hurt again and again I just keep watching. I try to prevent it , I tried to protect them but I always fell. I'm Always feeling awful. My life is so amazing .I have everything I need including them the most. I lack nothing. Its just too perfect. Theirs? not even related. At first I just kept worrying for days or weeks of Big serious problems. If I see one of them cry. Even if its out of nothing. I Feel soooo broke I cry too but not in front of them. I Feel disappointed. I hate mysthis. I get angry. I fell weak. I feel low. I feel nobody. 
Now I think its worse. I feel these thing if they are just sad or bored or when they are silent.( normal sadness u get sometimes which everyone gets and which is not a big deal to worry about for weeks.) My mindset is that being a friend is not just listning to what they have to say again and again. U got to do something to get them out of their darkness from the dark shit their in. U've got to do something to protect them from bad things. U have to be able to protect them. But I didn't. Couldn't. I still can't. All I have is ears. Just ears. Which is not enough.

My Mindsate is that if I am a friend , I should help them out through their darkness. I should help them. I should save them. I have to do something. A real deep friend is not someone who only listens to your problems. A friend has to do something not just listening. that's how I think and I can't do that. I couldn't. I Feel Awful every time they tell me their sad. I know its normal to feel this for the people u love but it's getting kinda worse .And if they cry, I crumble. At first it was like.. When a big Problem happenes and I listen when they tell me like I always do but couldn't do anything, I just don't forget their faces and always cry to let out my worry. 
It was hard back then cus the problem was huge and at the same time each one of them was having a very rough time. I was so angry at myself, very disappointed, I felt low. I don't even think that I give good advice. Right now ...one of them whom I am very soft with gets sad 'just the sad feeling u get sometimes,the simple one' I fell very Awful over normal..and I jeep think about it and wondering how to make it go away. I keep thinking about it even the net day. And when I hear their laugher or see their happy smile? I Melt . I swear to GOD. I just cry again. And again. 
My Problem is That I know things happen but I don't know what to do or what I can do To protect them from everything bad. they are so vulnerable and all they have is me.

2020-01-18 08:51:29,"Hellow everyone out there. I have been reading most of yall vents for the past few years and boy I can relate big time as a teen who's Confused and going through things what helped me the most was not friends family or finance(a hard word to use here but okey). Amin it's not that they didn't want to help at all but they just weren't the missing part. They have there own life and struggle to begin with and even though you talk vent cry hug kiss love understand and show love whatever you do with anyone you value at the end of the day they can't understand and know how deep your scars are, because there not you. So they can't give you what you really need yet how much they may try and be a friend for you that just can't solve your problem and worries in the present or future. We humans beings often forget we have a spirt with in us because it hasn't come to life yet. Our flesh our body and everything we use daily have consumed our mind and soul which is making us forget we are much higher beings than the things that surround us. Now am not being some wired guy which is blabbing about his day dreams in a class which he fell asleep.(because that's not the case). But what I really want you to foucs and understand is this is not it. Angels have spirits but they don't have bodies like us. When the universe was created its just a physical thing with out a spirt(trust me in this one, don't try to find your self in zodiac and astrology , ik your looking for answer but boy your looking in the wrong place ). What makes us very different is we are the combination of spirt and flesh. As we use our bodies to exist touch feel and know in the physical world, we also have a spirit within us which makes us available in the spirit dimensions if used properly. Now if u don't belive me that you have a spirit I won't blame you because one can not know which one can not see. And which one can not see one can not imagine and think bout it. But if you want evidence you may try to see what is happening since the birth man. To be continued if demand... If not cool‍",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.7778031826019287

Hello everyone I’m a girl who is 24 and it’s been 2 years since I started running business of my family. I have been in a relationship with this guy for more than 4 years. I swear God knows how much I love this man. We have been friends since 7th grade and his literally my family. When we first met he wasn’t the type of guy for a relationship and yes there were times I cried all night but now I can say that I’m happy, his changed and is still in progress. Btw I’m the wifey material the way I care for him like it won’t even be an exaggeration to say I  value him more than I value my self. Suddenly I met this guy at first I wasn’t even interested to just talk to him but as times passed by we starting talking, his a very good guy and the way he treats me I can’t even explain. He showed me what I have been missing. Amazingly my boyfriend knows about him he even knows when I go see him and he also knows that his interested in me yet what he says is you deserve better so it’s your choice to make.  So what do y’all think do you think I should end things with the love of my life for the thing I actually deserve or still wait for him to change.

I knew her since middle school but we weren't that close because I'm awkward and she's very quiet. I always felt that she might be interesting to know but I never approached her. When we joined campus I got her number from a friend of mine and found the courage to talk to her. And god she was perfect, smart, cute, cool, funny, insane, dark, humorous, intriguing. It was just too much to the point that I was scared to talk to her (I'm still very much scared of her, it's like I'm a teenage again). Which is funny cause for a guy obsessed on people's flaws I couldn't find any on her. So I started distancing myself. But after some time she caught on and asked why I'm doing that. I said nothing and kept on talking to her like old times. And then the enivitable happened, I fell. But I didn't tell her because I'm 22 and I never dated. I only know friendship so I was clueless on how to make her mine.
Then one day we were joking about something and my stupid ass decided to tell her that I want her to be my gf. And as soon as I saw her reaction I regreted it so bad. She didn't say anything about it that day or any day after it. 
So we just acted like nothing happened but after that day my love for her just got.... She's all I think about. When she saw that, she said we have to stop talking since she doesn't feel the same. That hurt... bad. But I obliged. We both knew that's the only choice. But days pass and we are back to talking again. Sometimes she tells me to go since it's not right and she's not that selfish and other days she's torturing me because she enjoys it (her words). She's a walking paradox that girl.
Anyway the other day she said something to intentionaly stab me with it and we haven't talked ever since.

I thought about letting go of having a religion and just believing and praying and obeying God's words until I die. But idek what God's words are anymore. There are some things in Ortodox Bible that aren't in the actual Bible that people all over the world use. And I really like REALLY hate that people in my religion believe in and mesged for paintings made by a human which are supposed to be what Jesus Christ or Mary or St. Michael and others look like. I can't stress this much. I want to be religion-less and live with faith. But I need to be baptized. And idk which baptism is right.

Hide my identity 
I want to vent. 

I met this my friend after so many years and I went to stay with his family, i fell in love with his sister, asked her out and we started dating. Although i didn't tell my friend about the relationship at first but i told his mum. to cut the long story short  everyone got to find out about it and i was asked to leave the house. 
My friend has told me he doesn't want to ever have anything to do with me and i should stop dating his sister. Her father has threatened to disown her if he finds out we're still dating. But we love each other and we can't break up at the moment. Although we're keeping everything as a secret for now.

I thought I fell in love. I thought I found my soulmate. I thought everything was perfect. Why do you have to be like this? Why aren't you perfect? Why did this feeling that I know will last long had to be for you? 
Sometimes I look at my parents and think... You treat me the same way dad treats mom. And that's the way I never wished to be treated.
And what's worse is i can't let you go.
I sometimes wonder if leaving you gets me more punches than staying and doing nothing. 
I wonder if you would throw acid on me or send someone else to hurt me or rape me. That's the truth. I wonder that.
I thought that dating a bad boy would be awesome. But nothing is like in the movies. 
I gave you my respect. You manipulated me into going into bed with you. We didn't make love. We had sex. 
I can't go on with this anymore. I know breaking up with an abusing, narcisstic, selfish bastsrd as you is just going to result in more misery for me.

I thought she'd keep quiet but she was seriously injured and unconscious. I told her family she fell off the stairs and they took her to the hospital and she was cured but then she would remember anything and also she was bleeding a lot from her lady part. It was obvious to my family what happened but they thought the zebegna did it. he was fired and sued, the zebegna left to Sudan and never came back. After 3 week's what I did started haunting me and I stressed about it a lot. One morning I wake up and my brother looked at me and said I know what you did I was surprised and I asked him what, and he told me the whole thing and also told me he heard it bc I was sleep talking. He tried to black mail me but it wouldn't work, finally he threatened to tell Mom and Dad. That is when I punched him unconscious. I was grounded and he was taken to the hospital.

2020-01-23 20:49:47,"I fucking hate feminists. Men in todays society have no advantages over women. Women are treated equally if not better than men today. Like if women truly got paid less, companies would only hire women and not men. And also I dont believe that shit women say ""i can do whatever a man can"" like thats the stupidest shit ever. God created adam and eve differently for example in terms of strength, there is no doubt that men are stronger than women. Like if women were truly equal to men in terms of strength and athletic skills, there would be no WNBA or Womens Soccer there would just be one soccer and one basket ball league. To wrap this up, both men and women have their own roles in society. Both are equally important. For example making a baby requires for a man and a woman to mate not just a man or just a woman. This message goes out to all women: play your roles please and dont try to apply that ""i dont need no man"" shit because you fucking do and every man also needs a woman we cant live without each other so just shut the fuck up and play your roles and let me play mine, that way we can grow together.",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.868242084980011

1) Everyone has the right to choose the way live, be gay if you want, have sex with everyone you see, you can do whatever you want. God gave you the freedom to choose.
2) But after doing those things you must man up and accept the consequences. after sleeping with hundreds of girls, if catch AIDS bro its on you not on God. if after doing drugs you get your life messed up girl its on you not on God, not on your family stop that blaming shit.
3) choose life that you may live or choose death and then you die. God is not a dictator, everyone reading this has free will. but God is just Judge and the wages of sin is death. don't try to justify your sin saying its ok or I didn't mean it.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9781258702278137

So I have a question 
Why is it so hard for our generation to have emotional intelligence?

Why is it so hard for us to meet new people?

Why is it so hard for us to be ourselves in a whole of our uniqueness?

Why is it the existance of someone with different views or background offend us rather than acceptance? 

Why is it we try so hard in covering up  our emotions other than say what we feel?

Why is it we always look for our happiness on others otherthan in our own selves?

Why is the past rejection of others affect us enough to lose our impending happiness?

Why are we scared of dying while we are  scared of living?
 
The best critic of the mind is the mind so be positively inspired.
U don't have to answer but self actualize ur own answers i believe  one way or another this questions have came to our mind on some moments.

My self esteem was no longer there my confidence too I wished I was dead so I told her my current problem and she just said atakabji. Okay guys tell me if this is makabed. 
This bully used to - pour water on my hair in front of everyone and make my hair go disaster so for the whole day I was laughed on
- pour a fucking spaghetti on my uniform and hair 
- rip my assignments off and make me go to the director office
- she will literally hang my pad into the blackboard and write someone is bleeding and sgeba everyone will laugh
And other wired stuff
So tell me this wasn't makabed....she made my 3 years of elementary life miserable. I once decided to just ran off to somewhere but where? I didn't know anyone...I also was about to end my life but who will take care of my mom? So she said atakabji and I let the bully end me. One day I had it and I beat the shit out of the bully with a lunch box. She almost died trust me her everything was covered by blood so they called my mom i was banned for one week and well, my mom, she was yelling the whole week and I told her why I did it and she just said if u would told me eko I would've change school for u right to my face  and I just said I know my fault sorry because apologizing is way much better than proving myself that I did. And later on high school, UK how they are it's always drama and boy problem and drama and that was biggest problem with me with the puberty and all and those 4 years was meh for me...so I'm in cooler now far from home, 4th year about to graduate next year and still if I'm stressed about sth I wanna talk it out with mom and she just throw the 'yhe chgr adelem baksh atakabji' phrase on my face and she start talking about her problems...I mean yeah her problems are way much worse than mine and I consult her and give her some advice and ideas but I need that too from her.

2020-01-30 06:54:20,"Hi, I was talking with one psychiatrist and told me about a personality disorder that is affecting many young people these days. I notice many venters here show symptoms consistent with this problem. It is called BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). 
A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by 5 (or more) of the following:
1.  Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behaviour covered in criterion 5.
2.  A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.
3.  Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.
4.  Impulsivity in at least 2 areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behaviour covered in criterion 5.
5.  Recurrent suicidal behaviour, gestures or threats, or self-mutilating behaviour.
6.  Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).
7.  Chronic feelings of emptiness.
8.  Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).
9.  Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.
If you have five of the above symptoms, better to see a professional help before you continue to get used, abused, and overused in abusive relationships.

I can say that the life I had before a year ago, could be dubbed as my best life. But it wasnt. Living in a middle class family with people that care was like the best blessing, but I had taken it for granted. I never really enjoyed that life, ofcourse it wasnt just out of being ungrateful but because I was facing different issues (from physical health to mental well being). I really would have traded the world to have become different. I was going down that bad slope. Then last year, life changes in an instant. Went even worse. Lost people, literally. Quit my meds. Lost a lot of money. I broke down. Went through some hardships which I really can't say. But it's just funny that now I actually feel better than ever both mentally and physically. I'm actually healthier. I have much much less right now, but I feel like every day is getting much much better and things are really exciting.

2020-02-07 09:15:36,"To all my fellow brothers out there who are dealing with depression, low self esteem and apathy...you might or might not know this, but porn and masturbation have a lot to do in triggering these emotions. I ( 23yo M) used to binge on porn and masturbation as a way of escaping my real responsibilities and deal with the eventual boredom. My actions resulted in self-disgust and I had to relive that cycle to rid myself of the guilt and shame. However these past few months, I made a commitment to put a halt to my addiction. I had my skepticism and doubts are first but the results were undeniably miraculous!! I started to become more confident, positive and motivated to do things that I previously avoided. I still have other wounds to heal but my life has significantly improved since I quit porn and masturbation. 
Of course some of you are going through other forms of challenges, but for those of you who aren't quite sure as to why you're feeling shitty, this might be it. Sacrifice your immediate temptations for a better and more meaningful future. Sexual tension and build up is inevitable as you withdraw from these activites, but you can transform this same sexual energy (which is the most powerful of all energies) into becoming more creative and driven for success.",approval,POSITIVE,0.9950639605522156

I'm very active, I love to meet ppl and have new experiences but I was always up front to girls about what I wanted from the rp. I just never found anyone that can make me commit until I met her. We met at a club i frequent, at first glance there was nothing diffrent about her but she was very cool and non judgemental...she saw me leave with another girl but still picked up the phone when i called her the next day. After that we met almost everyday, we talked about our lives and connected at a deeper level than I've ever connected with anyone. 2 weeks in and i was head over heels inlove with her, i never thought i could feel that way about a person. I can honestly say that she changed me for the better. But there was a catch, she was graduating in a few weeks. We talked about the situation and we decided that we were going to spend the remaining together but we would split up after she graduated cuz she's going back home and I couldn't do long distance for many reasons. After graduation she left and we stayed in touch but i continued on with my life. I met someone new and i moved on with her. A week ago the girl that left came back for a wedding of a frnd and we got together to catch up. As soon as i laid eyes on her all the feelings came rushing back suddenly it was 6 month ago and i was still inlove with her. The whole time ik i was doing smth wrong but I did it any way cuz it just felt right.So that night we had dinner and went dancing to that club we first met.At the club we started getting physical and ended up spending the night together. The next day i told her about my current situation and again she understood. She told me she'd always love me and she left the next day. After that I've just been stuck in my head about what to do.

My name is Betty and I'm a second year student. The problem is my friends, they joke about everything. They even joked about my kidney stones they call me names like teteram n shit. I'm sick of this but they don't understand that. I live around goro and because of that they call me betty goro. They even joke about my height cause I'm short.
They laugh at me when I tell them I went to the hospital because my nails got black and I was worried.
I hate it when they do that and they don't listen to me when I tell them to stop. So I started pretending it had no effect on me. But it makes me really mad and I can't metalat them cause they my friends.
Please what shall I do guys??",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9979094862937927

1. Start with urself....look in the mirror and figure out ur role(both good and bad) in ur problem.
2. Be woke.....as childish gambino said in his lyrics
“Stay woke, niggaz creepin’
They gon’ find u,  gon’ catch u sleepin’”
3. Plan ahead of ur days.....think about ur future. 
4. Find ur passion(find what u love doing) and work on that....develop ur brain towards that


Lastly please do follow these rules for all of u complaining about how to choose ur field of work and stuff. 
1. Choose what u love doing
2. Take risks on choosing what u love doing. Drop all things and only focus on ur interest. You can do it TRUST ME
3. Believe in urself and in ur passion",caring,POSITIVE,0.8143999576568604

Nothing much to say, it's just that i have this emptiness within me, I don't demand a shoulder or so, I'm OK with it I've accepted it basically, I seem to go through emotional shut down at the moment of crisis well the real thing is, I want to know myself, I know how I am but I believe there's more to it. I basically want to understand everything as it should be understood, I'm a muslim so I want to seek God in the same manner. I'm a believer of Sufism, I want to seek God but I don't know what to begin with. What I've understood so far is I'm nothing but an empty vessel in search of the Knowledge of God, myself, the reality.

2020-02-11 21:02:13,"This is kind of a message for those of you in this channel that are experiencing grief. Grief is awful. I never really thought of it as it is until I felt it in a way. I even used to make fun of people who were grieving. I never realized how awful and traumatizing it is to lose someone that means a lot to you. Even someone you just know. and what's horrible about grief is you have no guarantee that they're going to come back. In fact you know that they won't come back.  But let me tell you what Maya Angelou said once. She talked about how love is liberating. Love is selfless. Love says ""I love you. Whether ur in Canada, China, Tibet or any other country. I'd like to have your arms around me. I'd like to hear your voice in my ear. But that's not possible now. So I love you"" what Maya is trying to say is you don't know where they are anymore but that doesn't mean that you should stop loving them. Love doesn't depend on situations. So love them by letting them go. As for the ones that haven't experienced grief yet. We all die at some point. And I can't make this a warning saying you're next. I want this to teach you to not take people close to you for granted. Trust me, you don't know when it's gonna come. Or how. But it will. So love with all your soul. you always think that you have time with them until you don't.",love,POSITIVE,0.9955651164054871

And it hasn't been even long since we broke up but they have already started seeing each other... and she keeps avoiding me because, well i guess she feels guilty and to be fair, i did my research and they had nothing going on till after we broke up and, i guess i shouldn't get mad? I am so super furious to be honest, betrayed too but the logical part of me thinks i shouldn't and just let them be and still save my friendship with them... it is so soooo damn painful and i cant help hating them but i guess the heart wants what it wants.. am i being too selfish? are they really doing something so horrible? help me figure this out guys, im about to go nuts",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.996206521987915

I’ve had my eyes on this guy a while ago but he never knew me and I was never intending on approaching him because I was scared but out of nowhere one day he approached me and confessed about how he thought I was cute and how he wanted to know me and all that cute stuff so here y’all can imagine how happy and overwhelmed I felt. We started talking he was nice and sweet so I actually thought things were gonna go somewhere but at some point my gut just felt something off about him and trust me it’s not a comfortable feeling so I decided to check his account if I could find anything suspicious and guess what ? HE HAD A WHOLE GIRLFRIEND !! I was so pissed like I was soooooo hurt cause I always have my walls up and I was ready to put them down just for him and it just felt like an asayto mansat situation so I asked him ASAP if it was true and then he said yes that means this whole time he either had a girl he wanted to cuff or he was already cuffed so I just cut him off right there and then. But here is where the problem starts...for a month he begged me for forgiveness and that he genuinely wants me in him life and stuff like that and after time I figured that I’m over him so I forgave him and we became friends. So his girl posts him EVERYTIME they meet or take pictures but he keeps on removing his tag, doesn’t repost it and never comments on it which I find is a bit sketchy but whenever I post him he reposts it with hearts and stuff and he also posts me. These days we have been talking everyday and he says things that a man with a girl shouldn’t say and I asked my friends and they said he still likes you but he is confused but I wanted to ask you guys so I could get different opinions cause I don’t think he does cause if he did why is he still with her? I sometimes also feel like he is doing this because of sympathy like since he hurt me last time he just wants to be the good guy now but I feel like it’s a bit over bars and I am starting to feel more comfortable around his presence because it feels warm and sweet and I just don’t want to go through that pain again but I also don’t want to just kick him out of my life .

2020-02-13 10:09:54,"Hey, well this is not a vent. I was reading your guys vents and can't help but say sth about them specifically for the ones WHO FELT EMPTY
First when you have this kind of problems dont spend too much time wallowing in self pity. Try to solve it in the proper way. I have been there I know what it feels like just so you know that im not simply judging you guys.  And the first step to solve it is identifying the problem. Ask yourself why is this happening to me?‍ And the most common reasons why you feel empty is
1) you don't know who you are:
When you lose touch of who you are, what you want, who you want to be and when you feel like you have no purpose if this is the reason take time off, give yourself alone time and think about what goals you want to set, what you want, who you want to be
2) you don't have any meaningful relationships  ‍‍‍ 
So you felt isolated and detached from those around you, maybe not the quantity but the quality of friendships you have or the lack of intimacy between you and your people so find your small group of people be it friends, bf, gf or family who you can be open up to and be comfortable with,  the key to joy is not being popular or known but a close emotional band you feel towards each other

3) you haven't made peace with your past, maybe there are some unresolved feelings lingering from your past, or loss of someone important, or breakup or failure and now you dont know what you are without it now that its gone if so,  dont stay hung up on your past make peace with it, forgive yourself and aloe yourself to heal and move on 

4) you dont have any dreams in your life 
Dreams make you feel like you matter and you are meant to do sth wonderful in your life and trust me its normal to feel that way.  Not every one was born knowing their purpose every one takes the time they take. So look inside you and search sth you feel attracted to 
Any way you and only you know the reason behind your  feeling of emptiness. After that take action it won't be easy but it will be worse every try and the sooner the better.

I used to love him but now its really hard for me to love him like I used to . and we haven't had sex for almost 2 years and half which is hard to believe . and he is ignorant , he doesn't care about my feeling , he doesn't like to discuss about what's going on in our marriage . and please I really need an advice which is better than a divorce .
Thank you .",sadness,NEGATIVE,0.9896643757820129

2020-02-14 08:48:09,"Uhhh, okay so here here goes. My problem is with making relationships last, and I've been tryna put my finger on what the problem is but i can't. From what i can figure out i only seem end up with emotionally unavailable women who refuse to open up and trust someone. I'm extremely old fashioned. I believe in love and i think I'm really good at being with someone. I know I'm a little cliche with gifts, remembering certain days and just making random speechs about how important the person I'm with is to me. A friend of mine recently mentioned that i expect too much from women, and that in our current generation, love shouldn't be the goal and that made no sense to me. I know games work and all but if you care about someone, isn't it better if you're just genuine? I mean we aren't teenagers for the love of God. Whats wrong with wanting to be in a fully commited relationship where, i get to treat my girl like the fucking queen she is and wanting that to last forever? I'm sorta starting to believe noone out there shares my ideals and its scaring me. I don't want to settle for some mediocre form of romance, because i couldn't find my better half.

You don’t know what it is to love someone for their bad side not just flowers and roses but the part that cuts deep. Maybe that’s makes me hate you so much because you don’t know how to love or be loved.

I could not remember the last time I was that excited about life and the thing is I had the life I thought I always wanted minimal, with a decent job and just simple but thinking about it now I don’t even remember the last time I said nothing other than ‘አለሁ ምን እሆናለው’ when I get asked how I am.

After we said our goodbyes I drove home and came back to my dark, live-less home in the evening, turned on the lights and sat on my sofa.

I just kept looking around to see the house, how empty it was, the injera I bought yesterday lying on the table, the tea I made in the morning just the way I left it, and I just thought to myself

So i just decided since she wasn't rly comfortable being open with me I'd just be more of a frnd to her and confide in her so in time she'd trust me. It's been a couple of months now and still nothing. Classes and tests have kept us so busy that i don't even see her that much anymore.

I have friends but I haven't found a friend that's right for me, someone who shares the same personality as myself... Every time I'm on tg I'm ignored. I have a ton of contacts yes but it just seems like it quantity based not quality... As cliche as it may sound, the only people in my life I trust and feel alive with are my family.... I don't want to find a person to talk to but rather someone that understands me, someone who will be there for me when I need them most, someone who will be willing to take their time to talk to me when I call, I just want someone that's like me. It sounds selfish I know... Its just that I don't think I've been getting that happiness from the people I hang out with.... I act mighty and help those I'm not even close with, I take my time to help those that are broken.... But I'm the broken one and I've got no one (excluding my family ofc) that I can share it with... I'm in pain, cause every time I go online on this platform there is no one to talk to... I feel its best I get rid of tg but I don't know, I'm hurting inside but there isn't a person I can tell that to. I help people cause I genuenly love helping people but part of me wants them to know that I'm here, please notice me... Maybe friendship wasn't destined for me, maybe I'm just not needed....

Its been almost a month now since we broke contact with eachother. Not the first time I tried walking away, but this time I was determined never to return. There was only so much of the neglect and ego that I could take, So I respected her choice to remain quiet and fought all the temptations and impulses to contact her again. That was the easiest, a piece of  cake in fact, compared to what followed next. Little did i know i was prone to depression lekka. Endezih metfo new ende?????? I truely know what people suffering from it talk about now. I felt ashamed I ever thought that it was some kind of attention seeking strategy people employed.

Few days after the breakup, I was head to toes deep in a dark void, absolute emptiness. It did not improve the next day,  the day after that or the next week. It hasnt improved a bit eskahun. It turns out i was clinically depressed. Everyday since the breakup, I've been in hell, constantly fighting against a mind that's trying to pull me down into an abyss. It seems like Im loosing the fight and  I don't think I've the stamina to keep fighting anymore. Hope and vitality are slipping away from me. I sometimes wonder whats giving this empty vessel of a body an  energy to walk around with a happy facade. I'm convinced it is not about the breakup, that she left me with a broken heart. Nor is it the fact that I'll never see her again despite the love I've for her. I realize now that I've been broken all along. The incident just triggered it.

So this problem of mine..  y do people stare at me so much?? I get stared at wherever I go. And I actually catch strangers staring at me in taxis, on the road, everywhere..and some dont break eye contact..some do .
Some even make a weird face like as if am doing the staring.. 
What's funny is that my friends tell me about it sometimes , ""y this girl staring at u, do u know this dude?he was starin"" and it rly makes me so uncomfortable .
 At first I dint even Care or gave it a thought , then after times it really began to bother me like am I weird looking, or is it good news or what? 
And now am in a state that I cant function at my best in crowds because I feel like my every move is being watched and under that uncomfortable feeling I think they r judging and maybe ridiculing me. I feel like people just dislike or have a problem with how I look or they r judging .
 
Does this ever happen to any of u?
Is it some form of a social anxiety disorder ?

2020-02-24 20:52:54,"I'll get right to it maybe this will help. The only reason we are depressed is because of hope. We think things will get better we hope so badly that they will and that we'll make something big of ourselves, and then our minds plays this scenario what if i dont get my dream job what if i dont marry my soulmate what if i cant stand on my own and provide for my family. We hope for so many things in our 20's and 30's cause thats when we are in our primes. We expect ourselves to do so much to achieve so much in this stage of our lives that we get so worked up about it to the point where we can't even get out of bed to enjoy the sun on our skin the wind in our faces. Let me ask you this..do you know who doesn't do that ? Get depressed about their lives...people in thier 90's...there are no depressed people in their 90's because they are just happy that they are alive. They are proud to live another day. Regardless of their problems. So if am going to say anything let it be this..le chegerachin le depressionachin mefteha isnt trying to forget our problems cause there will always be problems in our lives..like always. Even if we are lucky enough to have none we are so fucked up that we create one...there is this saying that goes the solution to a problem is merely the creation of another. It is said that we need to work hard inorder to achieve our dreams but do u know whats wrong with dreams...they just dont fucking end...ehan lemar ehan legza..ezi lesras ezi lenur eswan bageba ezi beznana ene entenan bereda eyale it just never ends. So i personally believe the solution to depression is to just adore the little things and while we're at it just make little achievable dreams. Like if you enjoy doing smt then just fucking do it..and learn to be greatful for everything else you have and accept yourself for who you are..trust me everyone is fucking weird and imperfect but if you accept your imperfections youre probably going to be happier than alot of those happy looking fake fucks.",optimism,NEGATIVE,0.9960397481918335

2020-02-25 08:13:13,"So this is kinda the first time I’ve vented to someone about this kinda stuff but I guess here it goes. I used to be a fun and care free kid with a bunch of friends more than I could count with my fingers. But now I’m an anxiety filled depressed introvert with only a hand full of friends. How did that happen? Well you see I’m really into art and drawing things and I was actually looking into careers in the entertainment industry for animating back in freshman year of hs. But my dad didn’t like that and wanted me to pursue something else. So what he did was proceeded to down talk me and make me feel like I’m not even a person every time he saw me. My sister would also join in from time to time. This carried out for about two years with that I got depressed and started stuff. But with the of my friends I did get better and when I entered senior year my dad and my sister stopped bothering me. However I noticed I’d occasionally down talk myself wherever I do something. But overtime I found myself hear this small voice in my head just down talk me every chance it gets and it’s come to the point that it would prevent me from doing what I want to do and it’d lead me into depression episodes and gives me a butt ton of anxiety. I looked it up one time and turns out what was happening was self inflicted mental abuse. I did talk to my best friend about it and she helped me through it at the time. But it comes back then it leave and cycle repeats it’s self. Then I was going through a bad break up at the time and it didn’t really help things. What it did was just make me not trust friends with it and build up walls around me so no one could hurt me and my heart. Then I developed a crush on this guy at work. Then we started hanging out then one thing lead to another then next thing I know he says that he likes me. Everything just felt so surreal but it didn’t really last long (we didn’t get together on the spot since I told him that I wasn’t ready for another relationship and he said that he was willing to wait.). A few months passes by he was telling me about this one person at his work that he found cute and telling me about how much they had in common. Then out loud to me he ask if he should go for it. Like ask them out. That’s when I stepped back and told myself “they have so much in common you don’t stand a chance so might as well back down now”. So I did. I backed down...even though I still had feelings for him I just bit my lip and backed down.  I did hurt. I still kinda do but he’s still my friend and he deserves to be happy more than I do. It also didn’t help when he’d lead me on and making it seem like I had a chance with him but the next day he’d go for the other person.... It’s gotten to the point where I just act like I’m fine so he, my best friend, other friends and family don’t worry about me. I can never catch a break...I just can’t win and it irritates me.

I don’t wanna tell my family about it cause I really don’t wanna bother them about.

I don't understand what else to do! Here's the old vent, I hope it is posted. I would appreciate it if I could get real suggestions!
They've actually entered into our lives now officially and everyone knows what is their plan. 
Well here it is.. 
Why does it happen that people who are related through blood turn out to be the blood suckers? It's so painful to act like they act, I don't want to be like them but if we have to live, we'll have to confront them otherwise they'll eat us up.
I mean what should a person do if the relatives don't have good intentions for your family?
Doesn't it feel like sabotaging the very basic idea of kinship?
I don't want to doubt their doings but everytime, everytime they show their true colours! I'm so hurt I swear it's more like I want me and my family to just move to some far off place but again we are bounded!
It seems to be like a little problem but i swear when you see your loved ones struggling, it just becomes irresistible!
I'm in pain not for me I've already let it go, doesn't matter anymore but those whom I love, I can't see them struggle again the way they had been all those long years!
Why the hell does it happen!
I don't want to be such an adult who would literally want to kill their family the difference is no weapons are being used 
If that's how life is gonna make me, I would better be dead rather than making others life hell 
They actually want us to die in silence and suffer the most, and that too because who knows why!! We've been always at the giving end still we are the most targeted..

Hide my identity I need to vent
Hello there everyone this is my first time venting here and so here it goes...I lost my mother recently due to some unforseen accident and I can't seem to get over her death no matter what I do. I try so hard to be normal and all in front of family friends menamn gn at some point I just can't handle it and I breakdown bad. I want to believe that things happen for a reason and I want go to church and keep on believing but that has been hard lately. I just have this mind blowing question of ""why?"" in my head I mean why did it have to be my mom? Why didn't God save her from this? And these questions some how restrict me from going to church and praising God because deep deep down I know that he took her away from me despite all my cries and all my prayers 
I'm in a very bad place right now. I'm confused, angry, sad, lost, depressed, hurt...I just miss her so much things are not the same without her by my side 
I need help please 
Especially people who have gone through this kind of thing tell me how you became ur selves again, tell me how to move on from this gut wrenching feeling because every time I breath it's like someone is stabbing me directly in my heart and it's the worst feeling ever
So please people who have an advice or a word of help please don't hesitate to help me and for those of you who still have ur parents with you I sincerely pray that God grants them a long and happy life
Don't take their existence for granted because unfortunately there comes a time where you won't be able to look them in the eyes, hold them by their hand, thank them for all they've done for you and kiss and hug them
So for those of you lucky people don't hesitate to do it now...it will certainly feel good to do it and it will make them feel very very happy",sadness,POSITIVE,0.798516035079956

Well, I wanted to share with you something simple that helped me in a way. For anyone who is not satisfied with their lives, be it anxiety, depression, procrastination or what not. Stop trusting that you know how to make the right choices. Something that has been helping me recently was stopping trusting myself. Because if I'm not satisfied with my life then I clearly don't know what I am doing. So why would I listen to myself?
What I did was look for someone who made it past the problems I am facing, and just start trust their choices more than mine, if it works I follow their advice, if it doesn't I look for someone else. There are millions of these people and its easy to find them on the Internet. When my mind trys to talk my myself out of what I need to do, I remind myself that it is my choices that are giving me the life I have, an dif i don't like that, I have to try choosing something else. 
Motivation is garbage.It is never there when you need it, you only feel motivated if something feels easy. You will never feel like it's the right time unless you start now, stop trusting your current choices until you are proud of who you are. Until then learn from others, do what they do and build yourself to be someone worthy of trust to get your goals done.
If what you are doing is not working, then try something else. Stay curious, and keep learning. Just wanted to share my thoughts.°",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9868489503860474

So recently I've been seeing a lot about feminists and stuff like that and I think a lot of people don't actually understand the meaning of the word. Feminism is defined in Merriam-Webster dictionary as ""the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes"". It isn't about hating men, or thinking women are better than men. And I get that it might make guys feel attacked because it's all about women rights but that's because most men KNOW they have rights, they know they're empowered, and men dont worry about whether they will have to forget about their careers they worked hard for when they get married and have children. But women still have all these worries and more. Look around you, for example If you look at the governmental campuses there is like 300 guys and 100 girls in one department. When guys walk down the street at night they're worried about being robbed but girls worry about being raped or killed.  You’re more likely to becongratulated for having lots of sex, rather than shamed for it or called a “slut.” You can enjoy partying without people blaming your “lifestyle” if you’re sexually assaulted. You can stand in a crowded area like on public transportation without worrying about being groped. Men don't have to worry about not getting a job because of their gender or worry that people will assume they only got their job because they slept with their boss. The list goes on. I'm not trying to attack men, I'm just saying that we don't have equality like you think we do. And for the girls out there that say they aren't a feminist, the reason you have the right to go to school, vote and etc are all because of the feminists before you who fought for you to have these rights. So  please please stop disregarding a movement thats literally fighting for your rights. In conclusion, if you believe that men and women should have equal rights then you should call yourself a feminist. Research and know what the word means before you hate it.

 But Sarah... She seemed to have the time of her life. She had multiple orgasms, which made me feel a little insecure about my past performances.

I told Sarah, after two encounters, that I wasn't quite feeling the magic. She encouraged me to continue. 
She also texted me naughty things throughout the day, including how sexy it would be if I violated our safe word. THAT was extremely unnerving.

We went the rest of the weekend without sex. I told Sarah I needed to think. It was during this time that Sarah admitted to me (while drunk) that she had, in the past, 
purposefully put herself in ""sketchy"" situations with strangers at bars in an effort to satisfy her kink. She said that she was ""glad she found someone who could satisfy her""
 because she had feared that one day she would push things too far and get hurt. I'm not sure if I even understand everything she said, all I know is it was upsetting to hear.

Long story short, I informed Sarah that I was uncomfortable with her kink, I was unable to continue, and per our pre-experiment agreement, 
I'd like to return to our previous sex habits. Sarah got really upset. It was our first real fight. A lot of hurtful things were said but essentially,
 she couldn't imagine going back and couldn't understand why I didn't enjoy CNC. Her logic was if I enjoyed play fighting in bed, I should enjoy CNC, because it's the same thing.

That was over a month ago. We've had a dead bedroom since then. It's like she and I are living two separate lives...
 By day we are the cute couple that never argues, by night we are strangers who dislike each other...

My head is still spinning. I feel like I'm living in a dream. Only a couple months ago I was in a loving relationship with respectful sex. 
I'm lost. Where do we go from here? Is it common for partners to explore one's fetish then refuse to go back?

I’m a guy so here goes my vent ..... me and my best friend started dating these girls which are also best friends it was going all good at least on my end and at some time they decided to breakup .... me and my girl kept on dating on and off until she went abroad ..... we basically ended it there so after a year my best friends ex started talking to me and we started chatting ... I didn’t tell him till this day of course he willl know but it never went further .... anyways we were talking and now out of the bloom my ex texted me and told me she is coming back after a month and she still thinks I’m waiting for her I know what your thinking can it get any more complicated cuz it got that’s a long story I’m really confused on what to do right now ...... should I tell my ex about her friend and ruins their and mine friendship or should I try to reconnect with my ex and break her heart ....

Why don’t you set a goal for your future and achieve it while you have time? I have a feeling that the strongly needed mindset for developing countries like ours has gone far from us way too long ago. With such a weak and lazy  generation, I doubt if Ethiopia will ever grow and become powerful as a country. Put aside all the stupid high-school and college drama and try to act a bit mature cuz Ethiopia is in need of her people more than ever.

My current situation is that I can't get over a so called ex. I don't consider our time together as a relationship because we both didn't have time for each other at the moment we started dating and the break up was mutual. The problem now is that we are sort of friends and every time I talk to him he reminds me of what I originally liked about him and at the same I am thinking maybe all of this is because we are friends if we were in a relationship he would shut off this side of him like he once did. But still I am thinking about him every single day and I don't know why. I mean do I like him? Should I pursue this again? Should I move on? Should I stop being his friend? I am confused so every comment is appreciated

It has got to the point where we can't differenciate what's real or not we are literally living lies and we seem to be fine with it. Sometimes I think it is painful not to pretend these days... all of us hide from our responsibilities and try to take the easy way out, some of us gave up on ourselves and the world and we just don't care no more, and the others are on the way there but a few of them are lucky enough to die young and innocent... we live in a kingdom of bullshit and we are caught up in things that don't actually matter. I'm looking at myself and i'm telling you i'm far from perfect we all are but some of us just refuse to give up. Even if it drives us crazy we just can't stop ourselves from trying to find something real in this shit hole. We refuse to see the worst in people even if it kills us. We want to be sedated all the time but that won't help because everyone else is busy recreating this bullshit so it is furnished so well that it feels real. I know we have to dig pretty deep to find something real and if we have made it this far i'm sure we'll get there someday

2020-03-04 20:00:11,I am in my early 20’s and have traveled here and there. Seen other people’s culture and rituals/religions. Well that made me question a lot about my religion and just religion in general. I just don’t understand it anymore. The basis of it is we are right and everyone else is wrong. God is only by my side and not everyone else’s( but they think God is on their side) You go to hell if you do this and that. You go to heaven cause you did what you are supposed to do. What we told to do benefits us I know but why can’t I have the choice not to do it well more than half of the world don’t even stress about it for a second. The world is so big and just too diverse to fit into one religion. Everyone is right in their own ways. If I wasn’t born Muslim I wouldn’t have been one cause whatever religion I was born into would tell me I would go to hell if I question and went outside. Anyways I am just struggling soul and hopefully I find an answer and I am not dissing my religion or others.

It wasn't because i didn't love you cause God knows i did it was because i felt numb. you weren't there, you never saw me fall apart, you never saw me go through life like a fucking zombie, you never saw the fire i had burn out. You weren't there when i cried my self to bed every night, you weren't even there when i tried to stop everything cause i couldnt wake up and deal with tomorrow. So how could i have told you that i loved you so much, more than i can say but if i had a chance to die i wouldn't look back, i fell in love with death way before you came into my life. But i cant tell you all this because now you are buried 50 feet under. Where i want to be the most right now.
I miss you",sadness,POSITIVE,0.9787083268165588

Bicha this question goes for those who ""Actively Engage in their respective Religion/Faith""... you may say I am more of materialistic than spiritual but this popps into my head whenever I encounter a pious person,so my question is this, What drives you to be devoted to your respective faith, have you ever considered the faith you practice today is just at random, inborn from your parents or society and not A Fiercly Sought Truth like the significant person who started the faith and have you ever wondered the chance that you maybe practicing another faith (significantly different) with the same intense devotion as you do now had you been born to such family?, and sorry final question, What (Honestly) aside from the pure kindly sides of your faith, what things from your childhood innocence have you lost and what challenges do you face each day with practiotioners of other faith?...

Well I am sick too,I need to get surgeryam just tired,plus the fact that no one knows makes it so hard,I am very sensitive and when my friends laugh at me or say sth rude I get hurt so easy..BTW this isn't what is troubling me right now, my mom wants a divorce,yeah okay am okay with it but what about my lil brother and my dad(he is on his final stage and she wants him to be on his own and he is a really small wager plus who is gonna take care of him?) I have tried to talk her out of it so many times but she just says I am tired this isn't the time that she thinks about people but herself,okay I get her,I do but can't she just be a little stronger at least till my dad reststhis really hurts to say it  but she is just so stubborn,and my dad keeps begging her directly or through me but we are just sweating it and now I kinda gave up..I haven't talked to her for like a month now and I have no clue of what to do or generally why I am living?

A few months ago one of my frnds that i have known for only a couple of months confessed her lover for me, I was completly taken by surprise but i didn't for a single second believe she was telling me the truth cuz how could she. She only knew me for just a month or so and even in those months I didn't feel any real connection other than a very strong frndship bn us. But still she insisted that she was inlove with me and vowed she would be with me and do anything till i believe her. Fastforward a few weeks and we're still talking n I'm doing everything i can to try and understand her but surpise surprise she wasn't inlove with me. She didn't do a single thing she said she would. So i talked to her about it and she said she was inlove with me but she gave up after she saw my reaction after a mere 2 weeks most of which i spent with her. And it's the same story with all the girls I've been with in the past. They just come on to you so hard in the beginning but then the fire just burns out and the words they said to you just become empty. Maybe it's the same with guys idk but it's still not right. You should consider what Love means to the other person. Don't say that you love someone just cuz you're attracted to them. You could be attracted to so many ppl but you can only love one.

Though we never had any future as mentioned by you in so many ways I learned what I felt was for the most part the infatuation that resulted from having to have had the unattainable. Truth is I'm sorry for whatever hurt blocks you from love and I pray for you every time I pray of my own heart. I am sorry it seemed that I was leaving although now I have left for real and I can't help but wonder if you are missing me too.. I am not good at these things but I just wanted to somewhat properly say a final good bye though I do hope I see you happy some day. Please forgive me for my less than acceptable actions during our time together and I have no right to minimise the relevance of my share of act and don't feel bad for your share now or future because I have forgiven you a thousand times I wish you all the happiness.

So at the beginning of the year i lost my sister, we were close and it really hurt when she left me. Before that i was full of hope and i was energetic. I was out going and so. Everyday i used to think of ways i could make my Girlfriend happy and feel loved but after my sister passed away all of that energy left me. I live in a fear that the rest of my family will die too and on top of that i started drifting away from my girlfriend. It's not that i stopped loving her it's just i couldn't find the energy and enthusiasm to do what i used to do. I sometimes told her that i missed my sister and stuff but i couldn't tell her i was sad and all because every time i raise that topic she gets uncomfortable and so i just stop talking about that. Days went by and we drifted apart. I couldn't find the energy to be the person she fell in love with so just one day she told me she wanted to end things. I am glad she did tho. It's not like i stopped loving her but i knew i couldn't handle her at that time. So now i am just sad and i couldn't get my self together.

What's the point of being a great guy known by the whole world? What has this benefited us? I mean C'mon why do we all have to go through the same routine? Why?
Shouldn't there be a change of something? Doesn't it sometimes look like kinda boring that we all follow that same routine and the fact that there ain't a thing that's changing. What exactly happens after we die? As most religions say It's probably gonna be hell or heaven. Why does this life suck? Why are we created in the beginning?
If the origin of life was something like we all know, why don't we see clues of that? Even if it's why is the former generation not letting us know how to survive and the purpose of life?

""I"" and ""me"" are words I use often and I expect others to do the same as well.

What others call ""friendship"",for me, I see it as just an exchange of ideas from one fellow human to another! Human beings other than myself, fascinate me! And so I try to learn from them. But they mistake my eagerness to learn as, ""she likes me"", ""she is interested in me"" and so on... Well yes! I am interested!

2020-03-26 09:12:12,"Today, takes me back to your birthday. That single birthday we got to spend together. I was young and clueless on how to make it special for you. We always notice from the movies and what not that one point of dating is having great birthdays. Someone must remember and make you the king/queen of the day. Shower you with good wishes and gifts possibly. It was YOUR day. 

But it wasn’t about the day, it was the goodbye. It was the greatest goodbye of all times ironically. I can still relive the moment even if it was 1 or 2 years back. It was dark. We were standing on the sidewalk at (somewhere). That was the same spot I had my first kiss with you, my very awkward and funny first kiss. But I have gotten better somehow after that, I hope. So you told me I had to kiss you before I go since it is your birthday. I was very shy and you enjoyed teasing that part of me. Ofcourse I said no but you insisted. I finally gave in, you were surprised by that actually. Annoyed me, scared me as hell. One would think I was doing something more than a few seconds of kissing if they saw the amount of time I spent thinking, convincing myself & deciding my moves. Leaned, came in all the way basically, closed my eyes and went for it. Heart pounding, I don’t know how long it lasted but it felt like the world stopped turning and time froze. It was beyond words could describe it here, perfect. We are in the middle of the road, strangers passing by. I stopped idk when and looked around, not believing that I actually did that. Infront of everyone. We both smiled. Gave you both your gifts and run away. You were watching me cross the road the whole time. I never look back but that day, I looked back. We both smiled with our eyes and teeth. A smile that said I love you. It was the most in love I ever felt if it was at all love. Got into my taxi and headed home. You texted a few minutes later, you rushed into reading the letter. Even at that dark hour where there are barely any streetlights. God knows how you read it but you did. You said something like how you almost cried and that you loved me, most probably. 

That birthday. That very memorable birthday. Maybe other couples live through this everyday. But it was that one day for me where things really settled in. Although I wrote too many things on that letter that I didn’t mean, I sure meant them after that moment. And I was glad I wrote it the way I did. 

You wouldn’t remember any of my birthdays afterwards. We didn’t even get to celebrate one. So I had to remember about yours even on mine. And get sad, get really sad to how it got to that point. How that day was so perfect and today we are such strangers. I wish I get to feel that day again, that feeling. I think that is what love was, feeling and living everyday like that. Ofcourse it didn’t happen so frequently with you either after that one day.  And it feels wrong to be living in a place where that doesn’t exist.",love,POSITIVE,0.9733048677444458

You demolished my walls with sweet words and crumbs of encouragement. And I fell for it. I fell hard. I leaped out of my tower to land in the safety of your arms but you turned away. You let me fall and you spat onto my ruins. Now I can't talk to you because you've silenced me. You accused me of trying to tether you forever and slashed my wrists with the tendrils of our bonds. It IS one sided. It IS just me. You DON'T reciprocate. You will leave me. You don't want me anymore.

At times even pushing her away. In high school I tried to kiss here, well on the cheeks that is. But still couldn't. When we got to campus, still couldn't kiss her cheeks. But I did get my wish granted and we started calling each other girlfriend and boyfriend, I mean at extended intervals. I had gotten what I wanted. Indeed, she was the thing i wanted most in life. So slowly, I finally got to kiss her on the cheeks. And as strange as it might seem, only that made me the happiest I've ever been. I had the greatest Adrenaline rush for getting to kiss her cheeks. Well, sadly it stopped there. I couldn't accept that and keep it there, i wanted more. Kisses, making out and even sex... So we went apart all because of me. And now I've kissed made out and even slept with girls. But the nervousness before and the delightfulness after I kissed her cheeks is what remains as my recent memory.

Some of the symptoms are diarrhea, dizziness, headaches and stomach aches. And i don't really know if its the typhus or if these are the symptoms of COVID-19.

So here's the thing I kinda have insecurities about myself because of my skin I have this huge part that covered my right side of my hip , it's darker than my normal skin I think it's birthmark I still don't know what it really is, I'm a light skin person and when you see my left side seems normal I was like this since my childhood , the weird thing about it is that my left side was the same as my right side through time it got back normal like my normal skin and my right side stayed the same ,idk what it is tbh I'm looking forward for medication but I'm choosing to do it after my graduation from college because they may ask me to do an operation I mean who knows? Or a laser treatment now my biggest concern is that I'm facing this problem when Im always about to hang out with my boyfriend I always fear that he might see this part of me while we're making out I start to push him away and stuff he still didn't see that part of me yet I always keep on distracting him with something else because we still didn't have sex or anything we're not even planning to go there yet because I believe it should be after our marriage but couple days ago I was like I should know how he would react idk why I kept thinking about it because I know no matter what happened to him I would always love him for who he was  and this shouldn't be a big deal actually but I was eager to know if he's going To love me for who I am so I thought of taking a picture and send it to him I told him there's something you should see and he didn't overreact or anything he was so normal he reacted so nicely and sweet made me cry to be honest he said this shouldn't be an issue he said I'm talking about this because I don't know how much I meant to him and That he ever thought of leaving me because of this he doesn't deserve my love and stuff he said "" le min gedal algebam bezi yemikerebesh ke honku ene le rebeshileshe"" belo liyaragagne mokere he was so gentle I'm thankful that I have someone like him I just hope it won't change the way he was looking at me I mean because he always talks about how I'm perfect for him and stuff I just don't want to disappoint him and want him to know the truth mawekum salemayker I thought he deserves to know what do you guys think about this should I keep worrying?",confusion,NEGATIVE,0.9933599829673767

So the thing is I have been suffering from not having a long relationship, since my first relationship didn't work out as I planned it and I got hurt, I used to get my self thinking about him a lot and I was damaging myself mentally, and after a few months I started dating so I could get over him , it distracted me for some time but not for long I was afraid not to get dumbed first and get hurt so I broke up with him before he dose, but after that I have seen my self changing, I mean I can't stay with one person for a long time I just get bored so easily and break up with them somehow, may be that is because I haven't find my actual type and i just said yes to it because they were giving me attention and I didn't  want that to go away. 
I know that might get the other person broken but I can't help it and get committed to the relationship.......
And lately I have been talking to someone awesome which is giving me a lot of love and all the affection i needed.. but am not that much interested rather I am attached to a guy that I have seen a couple of days before the quarantine which means about before 3 or 4 weeks and like him , I never even talked to him properly am just attracted by his facial recognition and I can't get him out of my mind, and i thought this is what love means and if i could have him may be my problem with not having a long relationship , getting bored and heartbreaking ppl will be away from me .
on the other hand I want to start a real relationship with someone who can give me his best. Well I already have him by my side talking to me but when ever I think I might get a chance with my crush, I feel like not talking to him! 
What am I supposed to do ? Am just daydreaming about someone who wouldn't even notice me and giving up on my other healthy relationships I will have , please people help me!

I’ve been suffering from somewhat of a quarter life crisis outlined by nihilism, depression, and loneliness. I can’t seem to shake off that thought that all my progress and memories will eventually have a definitive end. These feeling are exasperated by my analytical, introspective, and logical nature. As a software engineer which require me to be critical at my thinking, it’s hard for me to draw then line between which thoughts of mine are helpful and which are detrimental to my wellbeing.

This quarantine/lockdown, as much of a disaster as it seems it's an opportunity. Those among us (actually i believe it's all of us) have been suppressing their pains by distracting themselves have nothing else left but to face the pain.
It's a challenge to our mental health, as much lifeless as I feel, it's obvious others feel the same. But pain makes you so self absorbed that we look for a hint of compassion in the eyes of people around us and end up disappointed.
The reality is, we forget to look into their eyes for their sake. If we would, it would be clear that all of them are holding back their vulnerabilities.
Let's not forget, human beings no matter how much full of hatred, seek love and compassion. We can only heal, when we allow others to heal, remember your pain is as of different color and their of different maybe that's why it's hidden, but we all are in pain.
So please, don't feel forsaken, don't feel unloved because we all feel that way.
Please take care of yourself, please love yourself, accept yourself, this is coming from a person who has been through every kind of childhood abuse, not only me but each of my family members has been through some shit.

2020-04-12 13:43:33,"Hi there 
So ....I don't really know from where to start but might be a long one.

I broke up with my first boyfriend a year ago. We have been together for about 4 years. But then I just suggested that we should breakup cause .... I just reached my limit. The causes were ...he was always telling me I nothing better than him, I can't be accepted by anyone and its a big deal that he let me in his life, he wants to marriage but then left me for 4 years because he wants to go to the US, he chats with bunch of girls and delete messages, I sometimes find the ""I love you"" and ""I miss you"" message that he exchanged with other girls that he chat on Facebook and SMS and when I ask him he just says its brotherly sisterly, he never appreciates me, he tells me I should gain weight so that I can get the shapy look, he takes the lead to kiss me and all then he ends up saying he wasn't ready and he regretted it and he didn't wanted it at all the first place, ....ufuuu then I just felt my soul trapped and I wasn't being myself. He never allowed me to be myself or do what I love to do. He always said, "" You are not your priority, I am your priority "". I took that sentence positively and out of love for the 4 years we were together but then I find myself in deep depression. I wasn't happy with my life and all. So I broke up with him, and he just couldn't accept the fact that I am gone. He even calls and tell me no man will love me or that they will play with me ....

But then a year passed and then he called and said he needs his hard disk driver. So I went and gave him, and that day he begged me saying let's get back together. But it just feels late, I no longer have feeling. I don't know what to think of if we started again with all that painful and ugly memory. He told me he dated a girl and guess what I know the girl they were always flirting while we were in relationship. Anyway he said he dated her and she just treated him extremely in bad way, she even cheated on him. And he wants to be back and that am only his. And that he improved everything with his character and mindset. And that he learned that I am worthy and all. 

I dated a lot of peopl because Ielt lost at the moment. And just found it hard to be stable with any of the guys I dated cause tho they treated me right and they were all good but I wasn't healed. But then I learned how to be alone and enjoy myself. At the middle of that I started healing and just met someone nice. 

So anyway I told him that I am dating someone and I am comfortable with the person I am. Even if I wouldn't have been comfortable, I can't get back together as I just released that I was way blind in the past 4 years. Way blind that we are very different people, don't know how we even we made it through for 4 years. I was way blind that I wasn't happy with him, I was filled with abusive thoughts he feed me about myself image. Then he just changed immediately after I told him I am dating and he said he is the victim and his ego and his drama just started. He blocks unblock me every now and then. And texts me he is a Vitim of all the situation.   

Guys what do you think ? I really don't feel like this will work out in any way, and I can feel it in my heart that he is not changed. And on the other side, I am really comfortable with the one am dating now.

You might say like there is no use of writing it here. But I just vented cause I felt like talking it out. Its just feels so much better when I let it out.

I don't like to hang out with people and just when I think I found some one that's good for me they'll make comments like that person doesn't want u, ur just clingy and believe it or not they say that in front of the person I thought was my friend and that person laughs along. I satarrted crying by myself and I never showed a hint of pain for them. It's all bottled up inside me and I think it's eating me alive. Some people tell me I should be a model and that I'm very beautiful but I don't feel that way because of the people that criticize me. One person even said that I was the prettiest girl in the school but I just thought he was trying to make fun of me and I stopped going wherever he is. And I also have a serious problem, that is I tend to distance myself from people and just I don't listen when they're talking. And I feel bad when they leave me. I have problems with my family.  I love them but I can't express it. Sometimes I just storm ot of the room saying bad things and I'll feel bad but I'll be reluctant to apologize.

I think this venting might help and thats why im here
 So its about my mom. My mom do not encourage me or appreciate me for the things ive done or im doing. She's not bad but when i do something silly or unusual she just start to insult me dedeb, matreba, dngay and more worse. So im always upset by this she just want to raise me by the ways she didnt  get raised and want to raise me as ""sreat yalew"" child actually esua mtasbew and i am sreat yalat girl and when i score good or average on exams she would rather search for smth bad than appreciating me. But does y'all's moms do like this? Im one of good childs but i dont know guys i dont know what she want me to be. When i do smth bad  she starts to megelamet me n saying bad words and more
Im sick of this sometimes she likes to be treated as a friend and when i treat her like that she again start to protect her pride and as a mom she's good i mean she does almost everything i want but morethan that my psychology is useful and she dont see it that way.

I have always thought that he was toooo perfect for me! I mean, he was! He really was! He never treats me wrong! He always supports me on everything! He was everything that I ever wanted in a guy! But around the time that we were seriously dating, a lot of things started to happen to me! specifically, my family! Well, in Ethiopia, something's are just bound to happen to you just because you're ""a girl"".... And so, with all those things in my mind, I started to divide my life into, my life with him and my life at home.... So when we talked or met, I don't tell him about what was going on with me and my family. And tbh, he always made me forget about them and I thought that he wouldn't see me the same way if I told him about the darkness of my family... But that wasn't reality! And after sometime, I started to break little by little and I stared to change! I became a pessimist and hated my life plus anxiety and depression were my best friends... But he still had no idea what was happening to me.... I got to the point where I almost tried to kill myself.... He still had no idea.... I wanted to keep what was between us neat and clean!.... Long story short, I realized that I was selfish and that I had to choose between, letting him in or letting him go... And my selfish ass chose to let him go.... That was the worst mistake I have evermade in my life and I still regret it to this day...he is still ""the one that got away""....and tbh I don't think that I will be with another person and am okay with it.... I am sure that he is happy rn! And just thinking that he's happy, makes me happy.....",disappointment,POSITIVE,0.8092846870422363

2020-04-15 09:28:50,"24 was confusing to say the least. I never knew who I was, what my dreams were and what I was doing. I spent so much time pleasing people. I didn't make time for myself. I didn't listen to me and my dreams.
I was depressed, still am. Nothing changes in one day, but it showed me what a horrible year would look like. I was also a suspect in the COVID case so had to spend two days in a freaking Ebola Center with just my parents knowing. This thought me the only two people that would understand is them. Next, I think I gained 12kgs this year. Bad eating habits plus no exercise did that to me. Past traumas also showed up everyday of my life. I was sexually abused as a kid so I never performed well in my relationship. I am never satisfied and I don't believe she is too even though she says she is. I also flirted with addiction so much.Sexual,material,substance.....they all crossed paths with me this year. Albezam lol

There were positives in the past year too. Finished major coursework at AAiT but withdrew to start again abroad. I am also on the verge of moving out.  My family members are healthy. I still don't know who my true friends are but I have some people that I care about and all are doing ok. I experienced a bit of life through this adventure. I really hope it continues .
My aspirations for 25 are simple. Don't repeat 24. I was lousy, emotional and never made myself a priority. This year I will work harder and smarter. I will protect my emotions from toxic people. And I will make sure I work on myself and only on myself. I want to drastically change my relationship with God. I want to thank him for all he has done for me and ask him guidance in moving forward. I want to lose weight. I want to save money. I want to see new places. I want to make new friends. I want the childhood me back. I want my confidence back. I want my smile back. I want to be that go to friend for everyone. I want to help friends and family. Not be the one that begs for help.
Today, on quarantined and solitude birthday, I promise to stop letting myself down. I will grow up to be a good engineer, businessman, teacher, spouse,father, brother and son. I want to  repay my parents for all the faith they have put in me. 
I am alone but it's fine.

I just want to let it out.

I looked at the world in a pretty much different way. If people made fun of me or bullied me, it never bothered me, I don't know why. I always felt like this doesn't affect my reality, God knows that's enough.
I never retaliated, I never avenged myself, I always treated people the way I would want to be treated, you know with kindness and all. I never was able to put people through what I've been suffering from.
Yes, maybe I was a people pleaser I don't know. Everyone has a good image of me, apparently.
What always shattered me was how all I did was interpreted as weakness. I was always seen as a weakling. It's not a big deal maybe, it's alright I guess. Even it didn't bother me because I was unknown to myself. I didn't know who I am.
Now that I look at people in eyes, all I see is sympathy. I Don't need it. I don't want to prove I am strong but my reality, nobody knows it. And I'm so much preoccupied by these small things that I've become self absorbed.
I can't help my people, I can't lend a shoulder because I'm not who they think I am, or perhaps I maybe a weakling after all.

I couldn't stop thinking about how i was the only child out of all 5 to be beside him and tell him  ""take Heart"" look at his eyes and go out and pray and whip for God to not take him away and end his suffering although i was too late and his soul already left by then.
 My mom and Dad got sick on the same day i remember feeding them and massaging them one by one. Then my dad kept thanking me saying ""God bless you my daughter"". He always said that whenever i do something for him but it was strangely a lot that Day. Little did i know it would be the last. After 6-8 hours he started losing ability to speak he kept saying random words i couldn't understand i was even laughing with mom csuse we thought he was joking.Then i freaked out and called my brother and we took him to the hospital (my brother carried him because he said no and couldn't walk). He was laying on my shoulder in the car. I don't remember how many hours but my brother left and i spent a lot of time alone with Him saw his pain as they put thr catetor held his hand and told him take heart. 
We then got sent to another hospital. My brothers and cousin left me alone with him there too. Thats where i cried and prayed. I saw his bodily fluid coming out and freaked. When i called my brothers they told me they were looking for a doctor to operate on him and said they're coming asap. They came later and all of us went home only 1 brother stayed with him.
They assured me we will see him in the morning and i trusted them so i went back home to my mom. We found out he has passed away the next morning.
Now that i think abou it my brothers knew the blood in his brain would kill him and didnt want to freak me out thats why they left claiming to look for a Doctor/hospital.

We live with people who we know for at most 7 or 8 yrs to live the rest of our lives with hoping they could make us euphoric till we die. But honestly this is the most misleading propaganda ever orchestrated by the brain.

It was our thing to sing to each other in every road trip and never miss his concerts.

5 years of hell were made heaven because you graced it.
How am I supposed to move on when we have been to every cafe,bar, restaurant, club and we made so many memories in them? So many crazy laughs and so many deep conversations. 
How can I move on the best part of me with you?
How can I move on when I don't know life without you?

After all, it should be done. You have chosen to move on and be brave. I have also come to understanding why people say ""it's better to have loved and lost, than not to have loved at all"". Though you have left, in the years we were together, I have built a conscientious personality. I understand I can't rip off all the memories but make peace with them. I am grateful for having met you. I am really grateful for the past 7 years as they have thought me alot. I might need to move to a new city or even country to escape your haunting memory but with time ,I will be ok. I will be that same vibrant, optimistic,cheerful boy only this time I will become a man. A man that has been through a lot and has come out unscathed. 

I wish you all the best. I wish you love and happiness. Most important of all, I hope he will see the fire in you and support you in chasing your dreams.

When Jesus came to this world some thought he was an imposter and others thought he was a man of evil power that can raise corpses  from their grave, heal those in sickness and give light to the blind. If Jesus did not come to Earth all these people and religious leaders would have been in heaven, but now they are rather in hell. I would have said he was not a God and i would have asked God of Elias to punish him if i was born in the time of his presence. Most of us would have said like that. What i am trying to say is that God could have sayed the words to do what he wanted to be done without putting all those people in dilemma and doubt without having to come to earth in first place. What is the point of saving Adam and punishing  innocent civilians and religious leaders who were praising him before he came to this world??

So in my last relationship I was overly attached to her emotionally and physically but  it got to the point where I can't keep my hands off her and whenever we are alone I grope her at anytime and she was a person that is insecure about her body and I always tried to  respect and love her that way but I just can't keep my hands to myself so I tried to ask some girls and most of them don't like it they think it's objectifying them but at any way it's not and at any means nessesary if I offended any of you sorry. But one thing i also want to share is I always feel safe around her and that's my comfort zone. So the question is. Is it normal if I grope my girlfriend at anytime or sleeping and I know some dude also feel this way and feels amazing... And is it considered as if I am a perverted or is it like a compliment and befor you judge me all this is done with open communication with her.

I'm a boy, 25
Few months ago I was surfing the internet and I found out that there are massage parlors in addis, which provide erotic massage services and a happy ending.
I saw that before in porns and I was so curious. I called one of the numbers I found and ordered the outdoor service. 
I never had a girlfriend and I only had sex  once before that day. I think that's why I was so curious.
I really felt very bad after that but I can't stop it still now.
It has become an addiction.
Its the first thing that I do after I get my monthly salary. 
I know it's a sin and it's no different from having sex with prostitutes.
I really  want to stop this and I think the first step is to confess to somebody.

I know most of you will roll your eyes while reading this but you'll only be proving my point. If you're attractive, you have no right to complain because your life is supposed to be perfect, so no one will show you empathy. When you claim that you're going through some shit, some will think that you're just seeking attention and others think you deserve it (yes, simply because you're attractive). If you speak with confidence, you'll be told you're arrogant so you always need to appear ""unreasonably"" humble. People also think that you're dumb, because hey you can't have both, and if you display your intelligence you become more of a threat, especially at the workplace. People expect you to succeed at everything but hope you fail so they can go on saying ""of course she or he is just a pretty face"". Members of the opposite sex are intimidated by you and when you do get approached, you know that they are not interested in what you have to say because to them you're just an object of admiration. I was not always attractive, I was a late bloomer and I know what it's like on the other side of the attractiveness scale. But before, I knew at least that people liked me for who I was, now I have trust issues. Of course there are advantages to being attractive, I won't list them because they're obvious. However, attractive people know that their looks won't last forever and fear that they'll just be an object that people idolize but one that they will throw away after it gets rusty. I'm trying to show some perspective to those who think that looks will solve their social life, because I was once of them , and look at me where I am today.",neutral,NEGATIVE,0.9757418632507324

do u talk to urself with care,love? how do u treat urself?... life is never an easy road and alot of people are gonna hurt u,u r gonna fail alot but how are u gonna talk to urself after that failure or that heartbreak? its one thing people hurted u ,betrayed u,broke u but do u hug urself and say its okay! do u give the treatment and those caring words that u would tell to a friend to urself? why do u want to kill urself,to abuse urself with drugs. would u want ur kid to be that? please treat urself as if u would treat someone u that love. fuck goal,fuck failure,fuck heartbreak. nothing of this nature don't have to determine ur self worth. u have to treat urself as if u are a new born baby,the world might be cruel to u but u are the one who is standing against urself with the world.",curiosity,NEGATIVE,0.9941726326942444

My problem is with people of religion turning this whole disease as a punishment from God? 
Ok so let me lay down my floor plan properly so you understand what exactly I’m on about 
An animal disease has emerged from China more than likely because someone ate something foreign this disease didn’t travel on its own it travelled with humans as carriers 
Humans have always had problems like war and famine and what not literally one person said that famine was the will of God but a contagious disease is??who told you that you could interpret the will of God? Maybe this is his doing maybe it’s not but it’s by far utterly stupid to create a whole bases for belief over something that isn’t certain? People do this when they are scared I get that but how about you guys be different and actually pray for a change pray that doctors and scientists actually find a cure for this thing instead of hinting at things you clearly don’t know of",annoyance,NEGATIVE,0.9988822340965271

I am a girl n am 20 years old. I was sexually harassed when I was a kid by 2 ppl. The 1st one was my cousin when I was 6 yrs old n he was around 15 yrs old I guess. At that time my mom used to ask him to help me on my studies and what he did was harassing me several times. The second one was our neighbour when I was grade 4. He harassed me once n he chnged his place after that so I had never seen him again. This killed me inside n made my childhood dark. My mom is very serious n aggressive person so we have never been that close. So telling her wasn't an option. Bcha I was very conserved person so couldn't tell anyone. Then after sometime I became busy at school mnamen ena I was unconscious abt it for years. I also kinda forgave my cousin...I mean we've never talked abt it plus he became religious person now.

I'm from a broken family and had no siblings to grow up with. I think that affected me in many ways. I didn't have an easy past but looking back, I don't hate it that much thinking things might have been worse. But whenever I think about what should have been, how my family had to be I fall into some depression. I sometimes wish I wasn't born at all but I've never had suicidal thoughts. I used to think too much when I was in high school. About everything. I used to feel everything deeply. I could remember what everyone has done or said to me.. I had ideas, I was into philosophy and I was always sad. Then I became attracted to nature... I was a lonely creature but I think I've found something that made me feel less lonely in it. But it can't take it all away. The problem is I feel more lonely when I'm with people. That feeling is deep and I think those who ever felt it are the only ones to understand. As I grow up more my sadness turned to some empty feeling. I don't know what I believe in and what I don't, I don't trust anything. I don't know what I support and what I don't. There's nothing I'm sure about. Those bigger questions and ideas I used to think about are lost and replaced by silly ones. Everything is blurred. I forget things so much. I was a good student I used to remember what I've studied but now everything goes away after an exam, the grades ain't bad but there's nothing in my mind. And I don't care about grades and stuff as much as I used to. I feel like everything is pointless... everything.. I always try to act normal I always try to learn something to keep me busy but I procrastinate a lot and everything goes unfinished.. I've lost my old friends and I'm not that close with my new friends. I always want to be alone. And now staying at home, everything makes me angry, I don't pay attention too.

Last month, a friend of mine told me that she had depression and i tried to help her by giving her numbers of psychiatrists online and sharing some methods to fight depression and telling her im here for her. We talked for a few days after that, and then we just kind of stopped talking... For weeks. This morning i got a call saying that she had committed suicide. My whole world is falling around me, because i know it is my fault and i know i could have stopped it by hitting her up, or calling her but we weren't talking for a whole month. I thought she had her family and best friends and her boyfriend and her psychiatrist to help her in this quarantine.. We weren't best friends or something, just friends who talk occasionally, but on the times that we talked, she opened up to me, and i tried to lighten up the mood, to share my experience at that time, but i could've done more, i should've tried to keep the conversation going, i can't stop thinking about how it's my fault. The guilt is killing me and i feel like the monster i am doesn't deserve to live while she's dead. As long as i have known about her condition, i shouldn't have relied on anyone else in her life to make her feel better. She needed all the help she could get and i let her and her family and friends down. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I have a cousin thats just a year older than me. He used to sexually abuse me for years starting from grade 3. He used to bring porn and show it to me and do stuff to me until grade 7. That's when I realized it and started to avoid him.
But even though he stopped that, I went on with the porn. I couldn't stop. Even when I was in relationships, I watch it. The saddest thing is for me it ruined the meaning of sex. It's somehow a tool for me to have fun. I had to get it whenever I want it. So finally it turned into sexual addiction. I was in love with the most beautiful girl on Earth but I kept on cheating. Whenever she's out of town, busy with work or on her period, I cheated. I used to think I have some kind of demon or something because I couldn't understand why I couldn't control myself. She was the best thing to ever happen to me but I lost her because of this.
Now this issue has ruined my life. I don't know if it's related to the abuse or if something's fundamentally wrong with me but it's messing me up.

Maybe I'm over thinking things, but she knew me for like 10 years, and when he came into her life, I can't help but feel replaced by both of them. I tried telling her how I felt, she said they would do better and apologized. I know she means well and understands where I'm at. And I'm trying soo damn hard to feel okay about it, but I can't help myself. This may make me sound like I'm jealous, but I'm genuinely happy, they're like my two favourite people.

I have a question for you guys specially for christians (protestants) but I'd be happy to hear from anyone. its about song or also called zefen (I don't think it have a special name in english). anywho the thing is I grew up in a christian family and the bible clearly says thats its a sin but I have this issue....when ever I get sad, happy bored and stuff like that I express myself by writing a short song about it. its my culture every since I was like 9 or 10 although the song was funny and didn't rhyme at all. I really sucked back then but through time I got better. The point is I kinda made a background research and I think.....I think.....on the bible when it talks about zefen it was talking about song written for idols. you know to worship them and stuff. but my intentions are totally different. I only use it to express my feelings and I also sing and play instruments (piano and guitar). so what do you guys think? am I sinning? should I stop? some of my friends also sing and are famous on tiktok and they ask me to collab with them but just because I feared it might be a sin I said no but I really want to do it and I'm seriously confused. I would normally talk to my parents about this things but they're living in ethiopia and I'm in NYC living with friends (the guys who are asking me to be on their video) so I really don't have no one to talk to about this things coz ther're atheist so they can't  see from my point of view. see you guys on the other side I guess",confusion,NEGATIVE,0.9813547730445862

My identity isn't important. But my story needs an audience. Please approve this vent because I'm convinced I desperately need help. 
This all started when I was young . I wasn't even aware at the time that what I was doing was fucked up or considered insane. Almost on a daily basis, I would daydream about hurting my parents and sister It wasn't because I hated them. It was because I thought it was fascinating and I wanted to find out how it would feel.  I remember this one time, I was in Sunday school and we were learning about how Samson killed a bunch of guys with just the jawbone of a donkey and I started imagining, in detail, how I would do that to the boy sitting next to me. I even told him about it years later and he laughed. I guess he thought I was joking.
As I grew up, these feelings evolved as well. I began to obsessively dream about hurting every person I saw... On the street, in school, at church, relatives, everyone. Obviously, I didn't act on my feelings. But not out of compassion but the fear of getting caught. I confided in one of my friends once, and she told me that I was probably possessed. I think she was joking. In any case, I don't believe in that BS.
Recently, a friend of mine sent me a video of a man getting hacked to pieces and you can imagine my reaction. For those who lack imagination, it was exhilarating. I started obsessively browsing the internet for similar videos and I now have a folder full of them.
Whenever I'm not watching the videos or deep within one bloody fantasy or another, I'm depressed out of my mind. Surprisingly I have never wanted to kill myself. I even truly considered it once and the thought didn't appeal to me.
I feel like all these emotions are building up to something big, something sinister. I think I require help before I lose my mind and do something I won't be able to regret.
Please Help Me

Hope y'all in good health. 
I'm 17 and a girl. I'd appreciate it if Christians (protestants) comment. 
I used to hate to go to church as a child bc of the overreacting teenagers and a Sunday school teacher that wouldn't stop asking me questions. When I get older I completely stopped attending all services including Sunday's bc i believed everyone was a hypocrite. In the mean time,  I'd spend hours reading the bible at night and pray whenever, until I met someone that made me question my belief. Told me that bible has a radicallly different meaning than what we(evangelicans) think. With a full proof that felt so true. So I stopped reading the bible bc, afterwards, it appeared super complicated. A year later i decided to drop the the new belief and join a fellowship. I Became the old me. 
 Then i started realizing that mojority of People from church never walk the talk. Including church pastors. Congregations are gatherings of hypocrites.
But before I even know it, I myself started drifting away. Found my thoughts far away from God's. I can't even remember the last time I actually read the bible for myself. I Become the hypocrite that I never thought I'd become. I had never doubted God -I still dont- but I'm out of touch with God. I really want to the restore my relationship with him.

am a man. I'll be 2nd year campus student the coming year. so as a kid girls really hated me. I mean they wouldn't play with the boys if I'm in there team. remember how we used to play abarosh mnamn as a kid. so anyways the boys would kick me out just so they would play with the girls. and then when anyone needs anything from me they'd be like ""heyya how u doing buddy"" and stuff like that. so techniquely I didn't have a friend growing up. but then I'm a  grownup now and I never thought about it through high school. but unknowingly it affected my r/ship with girls. I get super silent and shy around them. I mean I try to talk but its like my body won't cooperate. I literally feel stress on my neck then start looking down while I'm talking to a girl. and I also feel like they're just trying to use me then leave me after they get what they want. I somehow don't even trust my friends either tbh. I'm waiting for the day they'll leave me hanging. but funny thing is literally no one knows about this. not my mom and dad, not my siblings, not even mybestfriend. I was really trying to leave my past behind then move on but sadly it doesn't work that way. I was reading a blog about bad childhood memories and it said that I have to face my fears. I was like haha nice onebut then fr apparently it wasn't jokingand now I have no idea what to do. I mean how do I face my fear? where do I start? how do I end it? I'm super confused. I see all this people talking to girls without fear. I'm like but how do you do that bruhI see them as the scariest creatures ever created. like at first he created adam then when adam was like yeaa eve is like ""peek a boo""my bad, not trying to offend the ladiesand the worst thing is the prettier they get the scarier they are. none of my friends would believe me if I told them about my issue. throughout high school I tried getting my shit together and live a  normal teenage life but every time I faced them I was like is this moment ever gonna end while acting like I'm enjoying their company. I wanna be normal but how? facing them isn't an option tho. its just a terrifying experience. ena if u guys have any advice let me know. and I'd like to hear from anyone who can relate. thanks for bearing till the end

So, I have an abnormal disgust. I don't know if it has a medical term. Every little thing disgusts me; pepople's voice of some sort and sometimes actual people disgust me, like literally I'd feel like i'm about to pique. I cant eat if i see old people's faces and other people that my brain tells me are disgusting.(No offense, I'm just being honest)
The thing that disgusted me in one person could be the way they once said something, or the way they acted or sth, guys I don't really know, but the things that disgust me are things that a normal person would consider normal. 
I could be disgusted when people wash their hands in some way. I sometimes even remember one person that I know and think they're disgusting. Is there a cure to this?",disgust,NEGATIVE,0.9993594288825989

This is mostly to young (actually any age) girls who go out clubbing.

I wish it wasn't the case but we all know these things happen. Now I'm not saying don't go out or anything but aydelem drunk or unconscious honen, as women we always have rape at the back of our minds. Like I said I'm not saying don't go out at all because whatever rocks your boat right?  but why do y'all put yourselves in these situations? Like okay if you wanna get drunk (which I hope you don't because what even is the fucking point but I'm not here to judge) bring a sober friend who you trust to watch out for you or just don't drink till you black out and lose complete control of yourself and your body. its that simple.
