0,0,Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis Energy advisers have ruthless reputation Ken Garcia Saturday June San Francisco Chronicle URL httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NNDTL No matter how much you try to spin the facts the truth usually topples out This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader who quite equitably is suffering his own power crisis Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting blackandwhite problem How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy crisis sooner his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response to spend million in public funds to purchase future electricity without offering consumers the details of the pact The truth is he cannot although he has tried mightily And to that end he made one of his biggest mistakes yet no small feat when you consider he is at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in Californias history Rather than tackle the issues headon Davis did what he has always done use consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his problems Its a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a mere weekend hobbyist Davis decision to hire two former ClintonGore spin doctors to explain away his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summers threat of rolling blackouts If only in this case he could have kept his critics in the dark While the states taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills Davis was pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers dry It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help the nations most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were being Snopeslike in their dealings with the Golden State But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated Californias energy plight through his own inaction as evidenced by our sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and spiraling electricity costs early last summer Yet why suffer the facts when its so much easier to just scramble them When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis popularity ratings began shortcircuiting he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani who had been as ubiquitous in the scandalridden Clinton administration as the stain on a certain interns dress The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the press each day that they earned the label masters of disaster which may be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to envelop him If only he had considered the accompanying stink Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing less than ruthless partisan hired guns happy to attack anyone standing between them and a monthly paycheck Unfortunately for Davis the rhetorical hit mens salaries are being paid by California taxpayers who are none too happy that they will be socked with billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis lack of leadership So although Lehane and Fabianis monthly consulting fees may look paltry to a governor who has contributed to Californias lost billions it looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats sometimes known as Californias millionplus residents The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an antitax group from Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California Edison as consultants a generally accepted nono for public officials even those who worked in Washington And State Controller Kathleen Connell a fellow Democrat has rightfully refused to pay state funds for the ClintonGore castoffs because she said it is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy not politics as required by law Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of ethics its fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground Or as one member of a tax protest group put it We are adding insult to injury to have the governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough for damage control Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage but right now Davis is a metal helmet in an electrical storm His arrogant treatment of state voters his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his way out of trouble has left even diehard Democrats searching for a more palatable replacement That decision will come next year when Davis is up for reelection And the millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas Since the governor is involved it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale But by the time the spin doctors are through it may start to sound more like an urban legend You can reach Ken Garcia at or email him at kgarciasfchroniclecom San Francisco Chronicle Page

kvellandipstrategiescom kvellandipstrategiescom Jean Munoz jmunozmcnallytemplecom cc Energy Practice Group EnergyPracticeGroupmanattcom Subject ALERT As discussed yesterday Davis publicly demands nearly billion for electricity overcharges WASHINGTON AP California Gov Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and other Western states was a step forward But its actions do nothing about the overcharges over the past year he said The governor a Democrat has been criticized by Republicans who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand Davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation programs He also said the state has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators The governor once said he could solve Californias problems in minutes But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities putting California taxpayers in jeopardy said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction Sen Joe Lieberman DConn chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee said the FERC which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow to respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act The agencys response to the Western power problem raises serious questions about whether FERC has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets not only in the West but across the rest of the country The federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day imposed limited marketbased price caps on Monday in California and other Western states from Washington to Arizona The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues Months ago the FERC singled out million in alleged overcharges by power generators The power companies have since challenged the agencys findings and the matter remains in dispute To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California complained Davis He said that between May and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California billion They must be required to give us back our money said Davis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The state spent billion for electricity in and billion in and is projected to pay nearly billion this year said Davis Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market he said Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem He said newly approved power plants will provide additional megawatts of electricity by including megawatts by the end of this summer Everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable energy to California is being done except wholesale price relief he said This administration has minimized this crisis for more months said Sen Patty Murray DWash alluding to President Bushs repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity prices Bush has strongly opposed price controls although he indicated support for FERCs limited price mitigation effort this week Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get lowincome loans and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest where electricity prices have also skyrocketed Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price is laughable said Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican Hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem They make a bad situation worse he said After FERC issued its limited price control order this week Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent costbased price caps on Western electricity sales Democrats in the House however said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action,negative,neutral,positive,negative,positive,positive,neutral,negative,neutral,positive,neutral,positive,neutral,positive,positive,neutral,Positive
8,8,Forwarded by Jennifer RudolphHOUEES on AM From Jeff DasovichENRON on PM Calif Probe Focuses On DynegyMirant PlantsCommissioners Updated Monday May PMET By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesCalifornia officials are focusing an investigation into the states wholesale electricity markets on two power plants operated by two of the states largest merchant power companies Mirant Corp MIR news msgs and a joint venture between Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs and N RG Energy NRG news msgs according to two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission The CPUC and the state Attorney General are investigating whether output wa s withheld in order to maintain high prices over the past seven months at Mirants Pittsburg plant in northern California and the Encina power plant which is equally owned by Dynegy and NRG near San Diego All power plants in the state are being examined but investigators have found that the Encina and Pittsburg plants have reduced power during supply shortages causing market prices to rise But so far the commissioners said investigators have found no activity th at is clearly illegal Is it unethical Yes one PUC commissioner said But is it illegal No unless there was collusion This is the system we set up What the generato rs are doing would be the appropriate thing to do if you are going to maximize your profit to shareholders Spokesmen for Mirant and Dynegy flatly denied the charges What we did was both legal and ethical said Mirant spokesman Chuck Griffin There was a very forthright attempt to keep these plants up and running Unequivocally we have never held anything back Some of the turbines at the Encina plant are peaking units which are supposed to ramp up and down to meet demand Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel l said The plant is operated by NRG but Dynegy markets the power from the plant and tells NRG how much power to generate based on what has been sold Weve done absolutely nothing to manipulate prices Stengell said Electricity demand increases and decreases throughout the day Our production increases and decreases to follow changing demand Ultimately t he ISO determines the exact amount of dispatch A spokesman for Attorney General William Lockyer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation CPUC President Loretta Lynch told California newspapers last week that her office and that of Lockyers have enough information to take legal action against generators next month though she declined to name the companies involved and she said that the exact nature of the legal action is still under review We get really tired of these assertions with no evidence to back them up Griffin said This whole idea that any generation was held back at any tim e is completely bogus It is pure political rhetoric Mirants California power plants have run at full power during critical tim es except under one of two conditions Griffin said Either generating units were broken and had to be taken off line to be fixed or they were beginnin g to run in a way that violated environmental restrictions and Mirant had to get permission to run at full power any longer There are no other reasons than those two said Griffin Nevertheless several employees at the power plants involved have testified that generating units were ramped down even when the states Independent System Operator had warned of tight supplies according to one commissioner And a senior NRG employee at the Encina power plant in Carlsbad told Dow Jones Newswires that he was told by Dynegys Houston trading floor to ramp down the large megawatt plant on at least occasions when he knew power supplies were tight We would be told to ramp down the units even when we knew the state needed the megawatts the employee said Then the spot price would go up but we didnt really pay too much attention to that because as far as we know everybody was doing this We knew how much power other plants were operatin g at and we knew they werent at full capacity NRG spokeswoman Meredith Moore said that the ISO gives instructions to Dyne gy and Dynegy tells NRG what to do And there have been conditions when the I SO told us to ramp down during Stage emergencies Moore said Also one CPUC commissioner pointed out that the states deregulation law doesnt require owners of power plants to bid all of their capacity into th e market The states incumbent utilities who were forced to sell their power plants as part of deregulation also may have contributed to the problem accordin g to an ISO study By not securing nearly enough power in advance to meet the ir customers projected needs the states three main utilities contributed to Stage and power emergencies last summer and forced the grid operator to pay a much higher price to keep the lights on The utilities argued that they underscheduled their load so they wouldnt have to pay the generators high bid prices The ISO market last year had a price cap while other markets did not Mirants Griffin meanwhile said all the finger pointing isnt solving the states problem If they are going to get to a solution in California they have to get beyond silly political rhetoric Griffin said The real solution to the problem is to get new supply and if they are going to do that they have to make this market look attractive to the kind of people who can build power plants By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires jasonleopolddowjonescom Mark Golden in New York contributed to this
